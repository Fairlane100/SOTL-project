Do our academic assessment systems reward scholarship that addresses the questions that matter most to society? Using international business as an example, we highlight the problematic nature of academic ranking systems and question if such assessments are drawing scholarship away from its fundamental purpose. We call for an immediate examination of existing ranking systems, not only as a legitimate scholarly question vis-à-vis performance-a conceptual lens with deep roots in management research-but also because the very health and vibrancy of the field are at stake. Indeed, in light of the data presented here, which suggest that current systems are dysfunctional and potentially cause more harm than good, a temporary moratorium on rankings may be appropriate until more valid and reliable ways to assess scholarly contributions can be developed. The worldwide community of scholars, along with the global network of institutions interacting with and supporting management scholarship (such as the Academy of Management, AACSB, and Thomson Reuters Scientific) are invited to innovate and design more reliable and valid ways to assess scholarly contributions that truly promote the advancement of relevant 21st century knowledge, and likewise recognize those individuals and institutions that best fulfill the university's fundamental purpose.

Research at both the graduate and undergraduate levels suggests that the relationship between student and supervisor is a significant predictor of success and failure in independent research projects. One personality variable shown to be partly responsible for shaping the overall effectiveness of such relationships is cognitive style, defined as consistent individual differences in how we perceive, organize, and process information; solve problems; learn; and relate to others. In this study we examined the effects of differences and similarities in the analytic--intuitive dimension of cognitive style on the supervision process. Data were collected from both partners in 421 dyadic relationships, each comprising an academic supervisor and a management student undertaking a major research project. Findings suggest that analytic supervisors were perceived to be significantly more nurturing and less dominant than their more intuitive counterparts, indicating a higher degree of closeness in their relationships. This led to increased liking in the relationship, and significantly higher performance outcomes for the student. These effects were highest in dyads whose students and supervisors were more analytic.

The article proposed a student-as-junior-partner analogy. The purpose of the article is to describe a professional services student-as-client model that offers a more realistic guide for core business school operations than either the customer model or the partner model. The next section of the paper begins by noting the situations where the partner model is well suited and shows why it is not realistic for most programs. The paper then defines the client analogy, illustrates how it offers a better fit, and describes some of the insights that it suggests. For the undergraduate and MBA programs at the core of a business school's teaching activities, the client model provides a much more useful analogy than either the partner model or the customer model. On the other hand, the partner model is well suited to exceptional programs such as the Ph.D."

We learned that human behavior can be influenced by personal and environmental factors as in Bandura’s concept of “reciprocal causation.” For business statistics students, we implemented online discussions to extend student involvement beyond the walls of the classroom, increase their effort, and enhance their success. We chose business statistics because many students struggle in this course. In the past, in our efforts to aid with this issue, when we used standard online discussions, we observed that students had difficulty navigating through those discussions. They participated strictly out of compliance and several of their comments were repeats of each other. To this end, we implemented anchored discussions to assist with the navigation issue. We examined the effects of the two forms of online discussions based on the students’ feedback in essays they were asked to write at the end of the course. Using a qualitative data analysis, students’ self-efficacy emerged as an important theme. We found that anchored asynchronous online discussions (AAODs) are more likely to help increase students’ selfefficacy than standard online discussions (AODs). Moreover, AAOD students obtained statistically significant higher exam scores than students using AODs."

We used objective data from student activity logs from our Learning Management System (LMS) as well as peer evaluations from the Comprehensive Assessment of Team Member Effectiveness' website (CATME.org) to determine impacts on team grades and peer evaluations. We found that student activity in our LMS and conflict scores from peer evaluations (CATME) do correlate with grades, as do GPAs and credits earned at the College. We also found that, while the class was in session, we could use the data from the LMS and CATME scores to intervene with those teams that were experiencing conflict to help them learn productive conflict-resolution skills."

Despite efforts to curtail its incidence and prevalence over the past 20 years, its direct and indirect harmful effects have made it a public concern about the wellbeing of children, adolescents, and adults. Empirical studies as well as psychological theories have addressed different aspects of cyberbullying (e.g. characteristics of victims, bullies, and bystanders, prevalence rates, specific types of cyberbullying behavior, gender differences, intervention/prevention strategies, legal/legislative measures, etc.). While consensus is evident in some areas researched, significant findings in other areas are inconsistent, indicative of the inherent complexities of this phenomenon and the methodological problems hampering insight into the nature of this problem and its possible solutions. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the current status of the research and theoretical perspectives on cyberbullying in hopes of encouraging good scholarship, improved methodologies and thoughtful inquiries to better inform educators, parents, mental health service providers, policy makers and others so that they can more effectively promote healthy online and offline behaviors among digital users. This discussion reviews the definition and characteristics of cyberbullying, its prevalence, populations affected, gender differences, theoretical perspectives and issues of intervention and prevention."

CIS capstone courses often include an applied project that is managed with traditional project management methods (plan first, execute second). While agile methods (adapt to change through iterations) are making inroads, little research has been conducted on using a hybrid of these two project management methods in a capstone course. In this paper, we explain the hybrid project management methods we used in four sections of an undergraduate CIS Capstone course during the Fall and Spring of the 2011-2012 academic year. We also present the results of an end-of-term student satisfaction and critical success factor survey. We find that overall satisfaction with the hybrid approach is high among our sample. We also find that more client involvement and a pragmatic approach to initial project planning are areas for future improvement. The results of our experience and survey provide lessons learned and best practices for those who wish to provide students with applied experience that combines waterfall (traditional) and Scrum (agile) project management techniques in their own courses.

Students have a natural interest in gaming that transcends age, gender, and background. Rapid digital game creation is used to build computer games quickly and easily using game creation software that requires little or no programming knowledge. It enables the developer to build a quick prototype game and to view the effects of changes almost immediately. The process can be seen as learning-by-making and learning by-design, which are grounded in the learning theories of social constructivism and constructionism. Viewing the game as a system, students worked on an assignment to create a game prototype for a user, determine requirements, and specify the requirements using use-case diagrams and UML class diagrams. Students found this approach innovative, instructive, and entertaining. We describe this approach and outline its benefits. (Contains 1 table and 2 figures.)"

A key challenge in utilizing virtual teams is to support collaboration among team members who are separated by distance and/or time. In this paper we use a research model based on a combination of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and the Task Technology Fit (TTF) model to examine two approaches to supporting students in collaboratively creating and editing a report for an introductory course in information systems. In our study, one group of students used MS Word with Track Changes turned on combined with emailing the document among students. A second group was provided access to a wiki where they created the report. Results show that students found the Word and email combination more useful and easier to use than the wiki environment in completing the project. Further, there was no perceived difference in the effort of collaboration between the two methods. This study raises questions about the widely held belief that web-based collaboration platforms are superior to emailing documents among collaborators."

The availability of online auction sites such as eBay has enabled many people to collect items of interest as a hobby and to sell parts of their collection as a business or for extra income. As a collection grows, it becomes increasingly difficult to track through manual methods, and it is often useful to develop a computer-based system for this purpose. This case raises the possibility of developing an information system to manage a collection of sports autographs. This case may be used in a systems analysis and design, database, or systems development course to address a number of important topics such as: systems scope identification, problem and opportunity analysis, requirements analysis, data modeling, and application development. The case is designed to provoke interest and raise a sufficient level of complexity to challenge students to apply a range of systems development and database concepts. While the case addresses sports collectibles, its concepts may be applicable other types of systems, especially those involving other types of collections or ""one of a kind"" items. Since many students are likely to have at least some experience using online auction sites, following professional sports, seeing television programs about collectibles, or attending flea markets where collectibles are sold, the case builds in some way on their life experience. This teaching case enables students to discover how systems development and database concepts are applicable to a practical problem solving scenario."

An empirical interpretive research approach using direct observation is used to interpret, evaluate and rate observable manifested behaviors and qualitative content (i.e. discussions) associated with project-based team learning. The theory of affordances and social impact theory are integrated to develop a conceptual model that asserts that collaboration mode (collocated vs. non-collocated and videoconferencing supported) will dictate the quality of information exchange, progressive elaboration of ideas, and the social processes that influence team learning. Team learning is then suggested to yield better productivity and higher perceived interaction quality. Results showed that collaboration mode can impact team information exchange and interpretation and ultimately task outcomes. Further, collaboration mode can also create a social structure that influences the capacity for a team to maintain a mutual supportive and positive climate needed for successful project-based task outcomes. The results offer some extended insights into the technology-mediated collaborative learning process among students in a higher education context as well as in organizational settings. Theoretical, methodological and practical implications of the study are discussed."

Typically, students in active, experiential classes engage in real world projects for commercial companies or not-for-profit organizations. In the latter case, such engagements are often referred to as „service learning<U+201F> or „community-engaged education<U+201F>. In this paper, we describe a novel cap-stone information systems class where, instead of undertaking a conventional single-team, single-project experiential engagement, the students initiated a fully-fledged new not-for-profit organiza-tion from the ground up. The not-for-profit organization, The Online Business Guidebook, was founded with the mission of providing public education on how to start and grow an online busi-ness. In an unusual twist on a typical e-commerce class, the students both implemented e-commerce technologies (“active learning by doing”) and created and disseminated e-commerce training materials (“reflective learning / learning by teaching”), rather than solely being recipients of instructional resources. This paper describes the manner in which this class was run, the learn-ing outcomes set and evaluation methods used, problems encountered, and recommendations. We propose a replicable model and specific learning outcomes for information systems educators who wish to teach e-commerce classes with an active and reflective pedagogical approach."

To empirically test these claims, we surveyed 1,080 business and nonbusiness students from a major research university. The results suggest that neither the personal moral philosophies of business and nonbusiness students, nor the personal moral philosophies of business freshmen and business seniors differed significantly. Based on our results, we found no evidence to support the claims of critics who suggest business education is associated with negative personal moral philosophies of students. Further, the attitudes of business freshmen and business seniors concerning profit and sustainability differed significantly, yet in the direction opposite the one Ghoshal (2005) and others would have predicted. Thus, blaming the rash of ethical scandals on the amoral and ""profits-first"" theoretical underpinnings of business school training might be too simplistic of an approach. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]"

More than 800 required management course syllabi from 333 programs were reviewed for either explicit reference to the concept of EBM, or verbiage within course descriptions that was consistent with teaching evidence-based management principles. In addition, instructor, course, and institution-level characteristics were examined as potential correlates of references to EBM. Using a liberal operationalization of EBM (i.e., keywords or phrases that are consistent with evidence-based management principles), results suggest that approximately 25% of core MBA management courses utilize EBM in some form. However, there are substantial differences across categories of course content and depending on whether the instructor has a PhD. Evidence-based management-consistent syllabi are most prevalent at the MBA level in organizational behavior and least in international management and entrepreneurship. Suggestions for future research, as well as an exemplary course description from an EBM syllabus, are offered. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]"

As the product of social processes, all knowledge-claims are socially constituted rather than the products of an absolute truth. Taking a sociology-of-knowledge perspective, I argue that the social processes underlying the peer-review process warrant closer scrutiny. In doing so, I contend that there must be a balancing of the inevitable author-editor-referee tensions operating throughout the editorial process so as to ensure that a clear authorial voice is preserved. I offer suggestions for assuring the integrity of the scientific enterprise, while respecting the prerogatives and ethics of authorship. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]"

Business schools have come under increasing attack for their espousal of a strong form neoliberal belief system rooted in the discipline of economics and a lack of attention to practical and, in particular, heterogeneous national institutional contexts. A key insight emerging from a growing chorus of retrospective analyses of the crisis is the need for research and pedagogy to draw upon the breadth of social sciences to inform decision making under uncertainty and more prominently features cross-national variation in institutional context as well as systemic linkages between the behavior of individuals, organizations, academics, regulators and policy makers. While business schools are theoretically ideally positioned to offer such innovation and have done so in the past, the institutional barriers to change are substantial. Drawing on paired historical narratives of institutional changes to business schools and economic policy making, I outline a political strategy that leverages neoliberalism's legitimacy crisis to forge alliances with government and civil society actors who share an interest in fulfilling the promise of progressive management.

However, business students appear to be somewhat skeptical of this claim. One reason for this skepticism may be students' attention to recruiter signals concerning the importance of behavioral knowledge and skills during the recruitment and selection process.  In an attempt to determine whether the addition of significant behavioral coursework to a student's portfolio enhances recruiters' assessments of student employability, we conducted two studies using different methodologies. Results showed that when asked directly about their preferences (Study 1), a clear majority of recruiters (78%) indicated that they preferred business graduates who supplemented functional-area (e.g., finance, accounting) coursework with equivalent amounts of behavioral coursework. However, when evaluating specific student resumes (Study 2), recruiters gave the same employability ratings to students who took only functional courses as to those who focused both on functional and behavioral courses. Our results are discussed in the context of growing evidence that behavioral science is regarded as a marginal topic both in business and in business education. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]"

The model suggests that interns' emotional expressions (i.e., emotional masking and emotional sharing) and social activities influence the degree to which they learn and receive mentoring from their supervisors during the internship, which further influence interns' job satisfaction, affective commitment to the internship sponsor, and career attitude. The results, based on a sample of 167 college student interns working in the retail industry, indicate that emotional sharing is positively related to both learning and mentoring, while emotional masking is negatively related to learning. In addition, intern social activity is positively related to mentoring. We also found that the levels of learning and mentoring received are significantly related to intern job satisfaction, affective commitment to the internship sponsor, and a positive attitude toward the industry they interned with as a potential future career. Practical implications for the design and implementation of internship programs are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]"

The student-as-client model fails in comparison to the partnership model in several significant ways. For example, a major problem with the student-as-client model is that it implies that the professor has all the knowledge and expertise, and the only challenge is to get that knowledge and expertise to the student-client in a satisfactory way. On the other hand, the student-as-junior-partner model focuses attention on learning as a partnership--both students and faculty are looking for personal growth and development. In other words, the partnership model puts the focus on joint learning within a junior-senior partner framework, whereas the client model ignores learning and professional growth on the part of the faculty member. Equally important, the partnership model sees education as helping students learn how to learn. In sum, the partnership model implies an ideal that nevertheless stems from the real. The client model ignores the sense of an ideal while falling considerably short in describing the real. Thus, the latter's value and instrumental use are diminished."

A key factor identified in prior management education research as critical to the successful implementation of such instructional technologies is student acceptance. We use the literatures on management education, technology acceptance, and change implementation to develop and test a model predicting business school students' acceptance of a Web-based course management system. Arguing that such a system which transitions traditional course-management processes to the Web constitutes an instance of a process change, we examine the role played by various change-enabling factors as well as change-motivating factors in students' acceptance of the system. We find that perceived incentive to use the system, perceived faculty encouragement to use the system, and peer encouragement to use the system are positively related to perceived usefulness of the system, which in turn is positively related to student acceptance of the system. We also find that awareness of the capabilities of the system, perceived availability of technical support, and prior experience with computer and Web use are positively related to perceived ease of use of the system, which in turn is positively related to student acceptance of the system. Implications for management education research and practice are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]"

The salaries and rates of return for recent business school graduates suggest that the MBA has not, in fact, outlived its usefulness. An issue casting doubt on the rate of return on the MBA is that the degree represents a signal to potential employers, but may not increase an employee's productivity. Some have argued that the increase in earnings derives not only from human capital investment, but also from pure differences in personal ability. The increased earnings of people with MBA degrees could be partly attributed to innate differences in abilities and not to schooling. The expected rate of return for an MBA, while still high, has recently declined. New graduates with MBA degrees are reporting fewer jobs upon graduation than their predecessors. Given the sluggish economy, a few more bleak years may be in store for MBA holders. On the bright side, the economic slowdown has lowered the opportunity cost of an MBA: Wages and opportunities outside of business school are not as enticing as during a robust economy. Furthermore, interest costs for borrowing to finance the MBA are at historic lows."

The first centers on accepting the status quo as ""the way the world is,"" and the second insists that gender does not matter. We argue that a postfeminist climate is operating in management education, so that gender is no longer seen as salient, even while it continues to shape the culture in significant ways. In this context, the gender culture in business schools can only be changed by adopting more subtle strategies for challenging the masculine norms that persist in spite of gender's ""disappearance.""

The article began by critiquing the customary and conventional approach to international management training. The problem, not uncommon in training venues, is the one-stop shopping philosophy that treats all participants identically, overemphasizes informational components, assumes uniform behavior from cultural actors, and overrelies an analogical reasoning. Then Earley and Peterson is continued by building on work on social and emotional intelligence to advance the concept of CQ. The strength of their examination of CQ is integrating metacognitive-cognitive, motivational, and behavioral dimensions along the lines of Sternberg's triarchic model. CQ is not offered as an innate, static determinant of one's ability to navigate complex cultural situations. Rather, CQ is a basis by which cognitive, metacognitive, motivational and behavioral components of successful intercultural adaptation can be apprehended and, consequently, taught."

Another profitable lesson that doctoral students will gain from studying the history of management thought is the advantage of being an informed consumer of received knowledge.  Another lesson doctoral students will learn from the studying history of management is the danger inherent in relying on secondary source materials.  Historical illiteracy may explain another lesson of historical scholarship.  Widely accepted facts are often wrong.  Also, doctoral students studying the history of management will learn a lesson dubbed as a special advantage of the past, that is, it allows association with superior minds.

Inspiring interest, an important antecedent of learning, can be an uphill battle due to the ubiquitous presence of grades. Grades are meant to encourage interest, yet they often do just the opposite. The result is a grading paradox. We hypothesize that leveraging choice in the classroom can manage this grading paradox by increasing interest. In a field experiment in real-world MBA classrooms (N = 91 students), we found that a choice intervention, the opportunity for students to allocate the weight of several course components toward their final course grade, was associated with higher levels of two types of interest, triggered situational interest and maintained situational interest. This study corroborates and extends previous laboratory-based research documenting the positive relationship between choice and interest, and offers a practical tool that management educators can use to encourage student interest.

Many master of business administration degree admission procedures are based on a collection of criteria adopted and perpetuated without serious consideration of the predictive validity of each requirement.  Every group with a stake in educating and hiring MBAs, as well as potential MBA students, should strive to understand program selection systems and work to put in place criteria that accurately reflect desired outcomes.  MBA admission systems should be of the same high quality as the best systems used by the organizations hiring their graduates.  Organizations should systematically evaluate the quality of the admission procedures associated with the schools from which they recruit MBA-level talent.  MBA admission directors should be able to clearly describe the knowledge, skills and abilities their admission processes target.  For each identified competency, there should be a clear and well thought out approach to measurement.  Employers will likely find that a high-quality admission program has been built on a sound footing of program evaluation.  A sign that the MBA admission program is of high quality is that it is sensitive to the MBA-program curriculum.  MBA programs will be improved when investigators learn more about the connections between such admission policies, educational processes and career success."

The solution proposed is a body of thought called critical management education (CME).  CME is that body of educational practice arising from a research tradition known as critical management studies (CMS).  One barrier to the consideration of CME is that CME has mostly arisen and been most widely discussed and practiced not in the United States but in Europe, possibly because that is where a large number of new business schools have been founded in recent decades. Yet it is in the U.S. that the bulk of business schools, and the bulk of prestigious schools as well, are to be found.  CME does require that one accepts the core claim of CMS of the unavoidable presence of values. It does not require that we all agree with CMS on what those values are.  In view of implications for management education, they suggest that management needs always be taught in ways that explicitly acknowledge the political, ethical, and philosophical nature of its practice."

To address this challenge, we draw on the work of Pierre Bourdieu to examine MBA education as an activity with its own ""economy of exchange"" and ""rules of the game."" We argue that application of Bourdieu's theoretical ideas elucidates three key issues in debate around MBA education: the outcomes of MBA programs, the inculcation of potentially problematic values and practices through the programs, and the potential of self-regulation, such as accreditation and ranking for impeding development of MBA education. First, Bourdieu's notions of capital—intellectual, social, and symbolic—shed light on the ""economy of exchange"" in MBA education. Critics of MBA programs have pointed out that the value of MBA degrees lies not only in ""learning."" Bourdieu's framework allows further analysis of this issue by distinguishing between intellectual (learning), social (social networks), and symbolic capital (credentials and prestige). Second, the concept of ""habitus"" suggests how values and practices are inculcated through MBA education. This process is often one students acquire voluntarily, and students often regard problematic or ethically questionable ideas as natural. Third, Bourdieu's reflections on the ""doxa"" and its reproduction and legitimation illuminate the role of accreditation and ranking in MBA education. This perspective helps to understand how self-regulation may impede change in MBA education. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]"

The decisions of team leaders in fire zones are unusually clear-cut and consequential for the goals of the enterprise, but they are not unlike decisions faced by managers of most organizations. We suggest that three factors--underpreparation, acute stress, and ambiguous authority--can result in suboptimal decisions by team leaders on a fireline. Through detailed evaluation of the team leader's ten most consequential decisions in the South Canyon fire, we conclude that five were relatively optimal for the triple objectives of safety, speed, and suppression, but five others proved suboptimal. Much of their suboptimality is traced to the fact that the team leader was undertrained for leadership decision making, faced intense stress, and operated without clear authority. In the wake of this firefighting disaster--14 men and women lost their lives-- the fire service created a development program using both classroom and experiential methods for preparing its leaders to make good and timely decisions. The South Canyon fire and its aftermath point to the value of explicit preparation in leadership decisions by both fire services and business schools as part of their efforts to enhance strategic thinking and other essential leadership attributes for achieving organizational goals in high stress environments.

In recent years, however, its popularity has led to uses beyond its original application for management development. In particular, 360-degree assessment is now replacing the traditional performance appraisal. This trend toward multiple uses--especially administrative ones--should raise concerns, and we discuss its implications. In particular, our focus is on dilemmas created when a feedback tool is stretched to include potentially conflicting aims. We carry out our analysis on three levels (individual, interpersonal, and organizational) using three frames (cognitive, psychometric, and game-theoretical). It leads to the conclusion that if used for multiple purposes 360-degree assessment is in danger of losing its efficacy as a process to deliver honest and constructive feedback. We suggest that it is time for reinvention of the tool and its process methodology. In particular, we argue for the development of two distinct tools--one for management development and one for performance feedback. The management development tool would rely more heavily upon qualitative feedback and competences for development. The performance appraisal feedback tool would be designed around quantitative feedback and measuring performance outcomes. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]"

Where historically the focus of intercultural training has been on preparing an individual to work in a new culture, today's organizations routinely ask managers to work in multinational environments and move from country to country. This challenge has created a strong debate about how to prepare managers for such challenging assignments. How ought people be assessed to understand their readiness for such assignments? Do high intelligence quotient (IQ) people adjust better than others to new cultural challenges? The topic of cultural adjustment and its assessment remains compelling but incomplete. Our focus here is the development and exploration of the concept of cultural intelligence, or, CQ (Earley, 2003; Earley & Ang, 2003), along with its implications for training and education for global work assignments. Our approach suggests that training for the global manager should include metacognitive, motivational, and behavioral components. The CQ approach represents a significant break from conventional wisdom of focusing on cultural values for intercultural education. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]"

We explore how students regulate their in-class attendance and extra-credit participation in response to performance feedback. We propose and find support for a punctuated-equilibrium model (Gersick, 1988) in which students' responses to goal-discrepant feedback vary over time, such that early feedback generates little behavioral response, but late feedback incites larger changes. We also find evidence that student reactions to positive goal-discrepant feedback can be stronger than their reactions to negative goal-discrepant feedback, and that student reactions to in-major feedback are qualitatively different than reactions to non-major feedback. We discuss implications for theory and for educators. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]"

The once accepted Harvard model of capstone integration and learning-by-doing through case discussion is now much less in vogue. Consequently, strategy students today tend to experience a rather abstract approach to learning about strategy presented through the limited prism of a theoretical discipline. Even classroom discussions of cases are often guided by instructors to confirm the utility of a particular theoretical framework, instead of serving as an open-ended discussion of problems and solutions. After presenting our evidence and arguments against the current trend, we present some examples of MBA programs that give more emphasis to practice, including USC's Executive MBA program, where priority is placed on integration and implementation without sacrificing, we believe, essential theories and analytical skills. Finally, we explore the implications from our analysis for additional solutions in other strategy teaching contexts. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]"

A natural outgrowth of psychologist Robert Sternberg's triarchic theory of intelligence is an interest in leadership development, taking the form here of WICS--wisdom, intelligence, and creativity synthesized. Sternberg argues that leadership is premised on intelligence, not just because a healthy dose of cognitive ability is necessary, but because practical intelligence--particularly as it relates to the formation and use of tacit knowledge--comes close to describing and explaining what leaders display. Larry Greiner teams up with Arvind Bhambri and Tom Cummings to search for a strategy to teach strategy. They begin by covering the Business Policy course, from its 1912 inception at Harvard Business School through the subsequent 1946 expansion of its primary pedagogy, the case, to all courses in the Harvard Business School curriculum, and eventually to most schools across the country. The benefits of case methodology as historically practiced, they argue, are best understood via an experiential learning perspective as a means to bridge the much-bemoaned knowing-doing gap."

Educating Rita is, among other things, a cautionary tale about how disciplinary standards can homogenize and sterilize newcomers' insight, precisely what Art Bedeian's analysis of the peer review process asserts. Peer review is also among the most powerful socializing devices exercised by business schools, and is thus central in educating the professoriate. Bedeian, always the provocateur, follows a simple logic to make a profound point. To begin with, knowledge is socially constructed. Although the relevant literature is admirably reviewed here, this is not a new proposition. But, it takes on special poignancy when peer review is considered because the process is undeniably social in nature. The negotiations among authors, referees, and editors most certainly result in tailored knowledge claims. To be sure, peer review protects broadly accepted standards. But four or fewer arbitrators do not make for a representative sample, and the likelihood of idiosyncratic interests seeping in is enormous. Bedeian claims that the result is all too often the violation of authorial voice, that what authors set out to say is compromised, sometimes beyond recognition. Bedeian concludes with ten rectifying recommendations, such as greater use of footnotes, publishing referee comments, and a meaningful formal appeal procedure, all of which could be reasonably instituted by any journal."

March (born 1928) received his PhD in political science from Yale University in 1953 and went to Carnegie Mellon University (then Carnegie Tech) where he contributed to the origins of modern organization and management theory, initially through his coauthorship of the two classic books, Organizations (March & Simon, 1958) and A Behavioral Theory of the Firm (Cyert & March, 1963). March stayed at Carnegie until 1964 when he went to Irvine to become a professor of psychology and sociology and the dean of the School of Social Sciences at the University of California. There he began (with Michael Cohen) a study of leadership and ambiguity in the context of American college presidency (Cohen & March, 1974). This book discusses the loose coupling between decision-making problems and their solutions and gives reasons for leaders to encourage ambiguity, rather than prediction and control. The idea that choice is fundamentally ambiguous is a central theme to ideas about ""garbage can decision processes"" (Cohen, March, & Olsen, 1972) which also emphasizes the temporal sorting of problems and solutions. The general implications of such ideas were explored with Johan P. Olsen in the book Ambiguity and Choice in Organizations (1976), a collaboration that later led to two books exploring an institutional and organizational perspective on politics and governance.

We describe ""Project Ulysses,"" an integrated service-learning program which involves sending participants in teams to developing countries to work in cross-sector partnerships with NGOs, social entrepreneurs, or international organizations. In order to understand how Ulysses participants learn from their experiences while abroad, we interviewed 70 participants and content-analyzed the learning narratives that they produced. We found evidence of learning in six areas: responsible mind-set, ethical literacy, cultural intelligence, global mind-set, self-development, and community building. We also identified a number of processes through which learning occurred at the cognitive, affective, and behavioral levels, including the process of resolving cultural and ethical paradoxes; constructing a new life-world, that is, developing a new perspective of self and the world; and making sense of the emotions experienced while on assignment. The results of a postprogram survey confirm the long-term effectiveness of Ulysses in developing and enhancing competencies that are critical for responsible global leadership. We discuss the implications for theory building on responsible leadership and helping organizations leverage the potential of international service-learning programs for developing responsible global leaders.

Specifically, we hypothesized that the relationship between learning motivation and learning outcomes would be moderated by individuals' psychological hardiness. We collected data in two studies. The first established the psychometric properties of a newly developed scale, the second tested related research hypotheses. After controlling for socially desirable responding and dispositional learning orientations, our hypothesized interaction between participants' initial motivation to learn and their psychological hardiness explained differences in participants' postlearning motivation, depressive symptomatology, and reactions to their classroom experience assessed 2 months later. The study's findings have particular relevance for anyone who has ever taught or been involved in teaching. At times, for example, students can feel overwhelmed by the numerous responsibilities associated with being a college student. As a result, some will suffer a loss in motivation to perform and, even worse, a few will experience a severe state of depressed mood. Consequently, in this study we address these concerns and offer specific recommendations that could be implemented by universities and instructors to circumvent these detrimental outcomes.

Despite this fact, recent research suggests that courses designed to inculcate human capital competencies are wholly underrepresented in MBA curricula. Scholars have attributed culpability in various directions, collectively suggesting a broad devaluing of management education from one or more stakeholders including recruiters, business school policy makers, faculty members, and students. We bring forth evidence that reveals considerable agreement across stakeholder groups regarding the importance of emphasizing human capital competencies in MBA curricula. That is, contrary to conventional notions, business school stakeholders largely agree with practicing managers that human capital competencies are among the most important to be trained within MBA programs. This evidence suggests an Abilene paradox (Harvey, 1974) wherein the status quo of curricular misalignment is maintained due to a mismanagement of agreement. As such, we argue management faculty must deploy an evidence-based campaign that productively surfaces this agreement and moves MBA programs toward enacting appropriate curricular change congruent with managerial realities.

Using within-class data we found that changes in grades in the last half of a term were met with systematic and corresponding changes in the evaluations students gave to their instructors. Further, we found a relationship between change in grades and change in evaluations when controlling for both student and instructor characteristics.

We propose that institutions offering reliable social defenses, sentient communities, and vital rites of passage are likely to be experienced as identity workspaces. The fluidity of contemporary corporate environments and the movement toward individually driven careers has generated an increased need for identity work, while concurrently rendering corporations less reliable as spaces in which to conduct it. As a result, we posit that business schools are increasingly invested with the function of identity workspaces. The conceptual framework presented here provides a lens to better understand how and why business schools are called upon to fulfill a function of growing importance—developing management education that goes beyond influencing what managers know and do, and supports them in understanding and shaping who they are.

Both networking behaviors had a positive impact on grade performance. In addition, mean differences in vertical and horizontal networking were detected among the three countries.

A total of 66 undergraduate business students participated in a day-long AC. The AC included a combination of in-basket, leaderless group discussion, case, interview simulation, and oral presentation exercises, as well as paper-and-pencil measures including Big Five personality variables. Assessment was performed using three trained assessors for each assessee. These assessees also participated in a follow-up survey, typically between 2 and 3 1/2 years following AC participation. We designed the survey to measure early career progress in the form of job satisfaction, number of promotions, and current salary. Analyses revealed that student grade point average (GPA) was generally not a good predictor of early career progress, with the exception of salary. In contrast, AC performance was most consistently predictive of both intrinsic and extrinsic aspects of career success, even after controlling for personality and GPA. Results are discussed in terms of their relevance to academically based assessment centers and the career success literature. Implications are drawn regarding the challenges and opportunities associated with the use of AC methodology in business schools. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]"

Given the popularity of student teams as a teaching and learning tool in undergraduate business classrooms, as well as the near absence of research that has focused on students' definition of the problem, our purpose was to develop preliminary findings and spur new thinking about social loafing in this context. A definition of the construct was developed, and its key antecedents and consequences identified by way of exploratory analysis of student perceptions. The resulting hypotheses and conceptual model were tested using a structural equations model by way of a survey of 349 students taking classes in an undergraduate business program. Student perceptions of social loafing seem more complex than current views suggest. They point to student apathy and social disconnectedness as antecedents, and note that they take compensatory action when members of their teams social loaf. We identify issues for future research and discuss implications for instructors and program administrators. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]"

We found (1) doctoral origin prestige had a direct effect on the prestige of a graduate's initial academic appointment, (2) doctoral origin prestige interacted with perceived quality of publications such that, early in their careers, graduates of more prestigious doctoral programs obtained greater job placement benefits (in terms of more prestigious initial academic appointments) from the perceived quality of their publications than did graduates of less prestigious doctoral programs, (3) later in their careers, individuals who secured more prestigious initial academic appointments held more prestigious academic appointments than individuals with less prestigious initial academic appointments, and (4) at a later career stage, initial appointment prestige interacted with perceived quality of publications, such that individuals with more prestigious initial academic appointments obtained greater job placement benefits from the perceived quality of their publications than did individuals with less prestigious initial academic appointments. Our results suggest that recruitment patterns in the management discipline reflect an inherent academic stratification system and that doctoral origin prestige is an important determinant of early and later career opportunities.

It is argued that the stakeholders of higher education interpret grades as a currency that neatly quantifies learning, permitting market comparisons and exchange. This money metaphor objectifies education.  The economic metaphor and its effects on the educational process are discussed with the intent of increasing awareness of the implications of the metaphor.  The metaphorical linkages between money and grades are explained.  The social criticisms of money that help explain why the money metaphor is problematic for the education domain are reviewed.  The main criticisms offered address the intrinsic nonmaterial goals of education and the student-teacher relationship, both of which are poorly represented by the grades-as-money metaphor.  The implications of these criticisms for business schools are addressed."

But how is such a practice developed? The author proposes the use of action learning--in its original formulation, namely, through reflection on real-time work experience dealing with unfamiliar problems--as a gateway to collaborative leadership. Action learning is portrayed as growing in acceptance as a management education and learning approach that distills knowledge from a context to be used to provide learning to the practice as well as to the practitioner. The account demonstrates how the operating practices of collaborative leadership are directly affected by action learning and proposes that the two approaches are based on common principles.

Our aim is to help educators understand their intuition and ultimately enhance their instructional effectiveness by making better classroom decisions on the basis of intuitive judgments. We outline the limits of technical-rationalist approaches and then call upon relevant constructs and processes from the intuitive domain, including tacit knowledge and implicit learning, in order to formulate a working definition of instructor intuition. We also present various types of instructional situations that are suited for intuition, along with the benefits for teaching and learning and the potential limitations. Suggestions are offered such that instructors may learn to capitalize on the advantages of using their intuition, yet minimize the disadvantages, and also on how they may educate the intuitive awareness of their students. In this way, the accumulation of learned knowledge and distilled experience within an educational setting can be more effectively leveraged to enhance the performance of individual students, the instructors themselves, and the educational institutions of which they are a part.

Both Donaldson and Watson highlight the important role that theory plays in management education, but limit their discussion to variance theory--one of two fundamental types of theory in social science research. Given that variance theory has long been the dominant paradigm held by scientists and philosophers as well as the general public, it isn't surprising that both professors emphasize this orientation. Variance theory explains the variation in a dependent variable as a result of the variation in an independent variable. More generally, this approach attempts to explain a phenomenon using a small set of well-developed variables, embedded in a nomological net, tested with statistical techniques, and suited to predicting specific outcomes that are unaffected by the temporal ordering of the independent variables. Alternatively, process theory develops a causal explanation of a sequence of events over time by telling a story about how and why a phenomenon evolved as a result of the temporal ordering and probabilistic interaction of numerous events."

Macroeconomics students reported greater satisfaction when the group is compatible, whereas Marketing Strategy students preferred complementary groups. The number of group learning experiences and differences in group homogeneity provides likely explanations.

However, research suggests that too much choice can have negative consequences such as feelings of stress and regret. An experimental design wherein students were offered different numbers of choice options when previewing, as in a syllabus or other course description, a major class project in a hypothetical Retailing Management course, examined the effects of within-course choice on perceptions of the course. The results indicate that, before they are required to engage in the course choices and make an actual decision, students prefer to have more choice. This is evidenced by their perceptions of the course’s desirability and value to their future careers, perceptions of the quality and fairness of the course instructor, and emotional reactions to the level of choice. However, when required to engage in the choice, students responded more positively to having fewer choices. Likewise, students not as interested in marketing responded more positively to having less choice. These results are more in line with findings from past research, showing that more choice can have a negative effect."

Past findings that the most productive institutions for marketing education research were concentrated in the South no longer hold. In the last decade, interest in marketing education research is found at a large number of schools with most authors appearing only once in the two primary marketing education journals and most institutions having only one or two appearances.

Many previous studies have examined personality factors that contribute to procrastination. This study examines selected assignment characteristics controllable by the instructor that might influence student procrastination. Results found less procrastination on assignments that were perceived as interesting, that required students to use a variety of skills, for which students perceived social norms and rewards for starting promptly, and for which the instructor provided clear instructions. Procrastination was not affected by fear, deadline pressure from other assignments, or the degree to which the task was perceived as difficult or time consuming.

Analysis of data collected from an Internet question- naire indicated that the specific forms of innovation can be adequately described by six dimensions. Faculty adoption of innovation is positively associated with both support and extrinsic rewards. A comparison of the perceived and desired levels of credit for the six dimensions of innovation show incongruence between the levels of support and reward fac- ulty see as desirable and those provided by their respective institutions. More specifically, faculty perceive the reward and support systems to be lacking. A discussion of the key research findings and some suggested directions for future research are provided."

It has been an ongoing discussion on whether marketing educators should customize their teaching activities based on the learning styles found in their classes recently. This study uses a scale of learning styles that includes a measure of the degree of student autonomy from the instructor. Results from an experiment of marketing students indicate that courses using an active learning approach consistently receive significant higher ratings on learning outcomes and motivation measures than those using a passive learning approach for autonomous learners, but that there are few benefits for students who are low in autonomy. This suggests that though active learning assignments are very effective, they will not necessarily lead to positive outcomes for all types of learners. (Contains 8 figures and 3 tables.)"

Many important tasks, especially publications for promotion or tenure, are typically associated with deadlines that are far in the future. As a result, time management skills can make or break the success of new faculty. This study examines task characteristics of procrastination in faculty work. It extends work by Paden and Stell and Ackerman and Gross to the context of procrastination by faculty members. An online survey asked respondents to recall important projects they had recently completed. The results suggest that task characteristics influencing procrastination in starting and in completing tasks and projects are quite different. A wider variety of factors affected faculty member procrastination in completing tasks and projects than in starting them. These included departmental norms, competing deadline pressures, perceived difficulty of the task or project in question, and clarity about how to proceed"

Can students satisfaction with a course be accurately predicted by comparing their perceptions to their expectations (as suggested by the expectancy/disconfirmation paradigm)? The results of these studies suggest that the answer to this question is strongly affected by the method used to measure student expectations. When recalled expectations and current perceptions are measured together at the end of a term, the extent to which student expectations are fulfilled does appear to be a good predictor of satisfaction. When expectations are measured at the beginning of a term however, the extent to which they are fulfilled is not a strong predictor of course satisfaction. These results have implications for marketing educators both in terms of the role they can play in affecting their students expectations and in terms of the timing of independent course assessments they may choose to administer."

It examines how differing levels of choice can affect perceptions of, and feelings about, a marketing option. The course choice process is also explored. The impact of choice on students' desire for the option depended on the level of interest in the courses available. Perceived value of the marketing option to employers and for student's future careers was greatest when there was some choice, but not too much. Tests for emotional reactions supported the findings in that they also indicated that choice can be associated with diminishing returns, especially when the choices are not particularly interesting. The results of this study suggest that students do want choice, but within limits, and they do appear to place value on guidance and direction. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]"

This leads to creative ideas and solutions to problems. By establishing this ""improv mind-set"" in the business classroom, an instructor may be able to overcome some of the problems associated with the case method (e.g., shy students, dominating students). By doing so, the learning environment of the classroom may be enhanced, and case discussions and learning outcomes may be improved. To frame the issue, the case method and some of its challenges are first discussed. Then the improv mind-set is explained and specific improv guidelines are offered. Finally, the author describes his experiences with trying to establish such a mind-set in a marketing class. © 2008 Sage Publications."

Although some anecdotal evidence suggests that undergraduate marketing students are less quantitatively oriented, there has been no comprehensive assessment of the overall quality of marketing students relative to other business students. Using a variety of secondary data analyses from nationwide samples, the authors assess the quality of students choosing marketing as a major. The results paint a grim picture for the marketing discipline. Marketing majors are among the poorest performing students relative to other business majors both coming in to and leaving college. Results from a broad-based sample suggest that marketing educators need to start a dialogue on exactly what set of knowledge and skills core to the discipline are being offered students and their employers. The authors offer some solutions and point to areas for additional research."

Doing so is challenging and time consuming when faced with large class sizes, high student--faculty ratios, and communications-intensive courses. Furthermore, instructors observe that though students often express desire for feedback, some do not appear to use it. The results of this study suggest that when an instructor provides a lot of feedback, as opposed to a small amount of feedback on an assignment, students receive it negatively. The results also suggest that students respond no more positively than when offered no feedback comments at all. Results suggest that if an instructor wants students to be receptive to the feedback provided because they believe it is fair, because they like the instructor, or because they feel the instructor has a positive impression of them, the instructor should provide only a modest amount of feedback or a moderate number of clear and specific feedback comments. Alternatively, an instructor who wants to offer students a greater amount of feedback needs to allow them to revise and resubmit their assignments."

This article reviews research on resume development and presents a study that examines recruiters’ comments about the value they place on experience in and out of the classroom. Most recruiters indicate that internships, part-time jobs, and leadership positions in university organizations are better indicators of employability than classroom experiences. Recent changes in marketing/business pedagogy have led to more classes in which active learning approaches with client projects, field experiences, and skill-building activities are used. It is a concern that recruiters are unaware of, or pay little attention to, these classroom experiences where real-world knowledge and skill sare developed. Suggestions are made regarding how to include more business-relevant skill development into our classrooms and how to communicate these classroom changes to both studentsand recruiters.       \n             "

This study finds the lone wolf phenomenon among marketing students working in teams through self-ratings and the assessments of team members. Furthermore, the inclusion of lone wolves on teams is found to have a negative impact on student team performance.

Reflecting this, most organizations are at least aware of this new agenda and wish to be seen as taking steps to improve behaviors in this regard. However, there appears to be a gap between this evolving agenda and the comparatively low level of knowledge that marketing managers actually have of the environmental impact of their own functional decisions. We suggest that this low knowledge level may be due, in part, to the marketplace focus of foundational marketing educational programs, and we attempt to show how broadening the horizons of marketing courses can help students (i.e., future managers) more deeply understand the environmental consequences of their actions. We demonstrate the use of a novel business game, based on the Life Cycle Assessment method, as the foundational cornerstone for the development of a broad understanding of the environmental impact of marketing decisions and actions for the entire life cycle of a product--from raw material extraction to ultimate disposal. The results of an empirical study show that this approach increases students' appreciation for, and understanding of, these fundamental environmental sustainability concepts."

Laverie",2009,"Journal of Marketing Education","f12bdc29-28a5-3bd5-8b65-a268122f7f0b","assessment for learning dynamic assessment feedback group-based assessment peer assessment","Assessment is a prominent issue in education today. However, assessment of learning often occurs only at the end of the semester to satisfy accreditation agencies. An alternative is to conduct assessments during the course, not only to assess if learning goals are being met but also to assess student learning during the course. Assessment for learning puts assessment at the heart of the learning process. In this approach, students are active participants in the assessment process. The authors propose a new approach to assessment—group-based assessment (GBA), which includes in-class group learning, peer assessment, and peer and instructor feedback. They develop their approach based on theoretical underpinnings of the dynamic assessment theory and the zone of proximal development theory to develop GBA. The authors test the effectiveness of this approach in a study conducted with students using a one group pretest–posttest quasi-experimental design. The results of this study provide empirical support that GBA is related to students’ intrinsic motivation, self-regulated learning strategies, perceived autonomy, perceived competence, task mastery orientation, and actual performance. In addition, guidelines for implementing GBA are provided."

However, many college students are already in the workforce while they attend school. Many of these jobs are entry-level or frontline employee positions in retail or service industries, which can be ripe opportunities for ethical misconduct. However, most research on ethics and employees has focused on upper-level managers and CEOs. Although insightful, ethics scholars contend that there are more low-level employees who face ethical dilemmas on a daily basis. Given the increase of working students and the paucity of research on entry-level job ethics, this study investigates, categorizes, and analyzes ethical dilemmas faced by college students who work while attending school. This article considers ethical decision-making models and corporate ethical values as its conceptual base. A qualitative approach for this study was taken due to the scarcity of research on ethical issues faced by entry-level employees and the call by ethics researchers for qualitative research to explore the complex and psychosocially embedded nature of business ethics. The implications of the emergent ethical issues and values from this study are then discussed for marketing educators. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]"

Concurrent with this trend is a shift in undergraduate education from an instructional paradigm where the emphasis is on delivering instruction and transferring knowledge to a learning paradigm where the emphasis is on designing, developing, and creating a powerful learning environment. Withthese trends comes the dilemma of how to evaluate and improve teaching effectiveness. This has contributed to the growing popularity of the teaching portfolio. This article explores the concept and usefulness of a teaching portfolio for marketing educators. By defining a teaching portfolio, describing its uses, and providing guidelines for developing a teaching portfolio, the authors hope to encourage the implementation of teaching portfolios by marketing educators."

The authors describe forces of change that led them to completely redesign their marketing curriculum, and they chronicle a replicable process that can be used to develop and launch an extensive transformation of an existing program that is focused yet adaptive. The process includes faculty commitment, consensus, collaboration, and compromise; stake-holder input; points of distinction; unifying themes; intended learning outcomes; instructional design; approval; a transition plan; launch; and evaluation and continuous improvement. The authors believe that departments of any size can implement a similar redesign process to develop a curriculum that is strategically consistent with the department's core competencies and focused on learning outcomes that are fundamental to any marketing career. © 2007 Sage Publications."

The case study attempts to address the dearth of recent literature on client-sponsored research projects in the discipline of marketing. Evaluation results provided from students in a 3-year period indicate support for the use of client-sponsored projects because they provide a number of benefits. In particular, students feel that such projects give invaluable opportunities to develop consulting and research skills that are highly sought after by industry. However, despite the advantages of the client-sponsored research projects, the quantitative nature of the marketing research subject is still an impediment to attaining high student quality teaching scores. Furthermore, there can be problems if students lack basic statistical knowledge, do not practice SPSS outside of class, and segment project tasks within the team. Finally, although client-sponsored marketing research projects can improve the profile of marketing research courses, they demand high levels of energy by the lecturer, a small class size (up to 35 students), and are dependent on a strong degree of client commitment."

Teambased learning (TBL) is an innovative teaching strategy using semiformalized guidelines aimed to enhance student engagement and improve teamwork and, hence, overcome the typical problems faced by educators. This case study examines the firsttime use of TBL in a postgraduate marketing subject at an Australian university. The results indicate that the TBL innovation has a positive influence on student engagement and offers opportunities to assist learning. The study concludes that TBL is an effective teaching process enabling educators to offer students enhanced and stimulating learning experiences. The case study contributes to the marketing education literature by assessing the first-time TBL experience of students and educator. Key issues addressed are student engagement, opportunities for learning, and the benefits of teamwork in preparing students for the workforce. Significantly, the research also offers practical advice for marketing educators desirous of developing and implementing effective and engaging pedagogy via TBL"

Moreover, they should be mindful of professional ethical codes and common ground that healthcare and IS professions share, particularly with regard to ethical principles of beneficence, autonomy, fidelity, and justice. The purpose of this paper is to present ways to integrate healthcare ethical issues within IS education. To this end, we discuss the notion of a mutual understanding of bioethics and present professional codes of ethics as an advance organizer. We also offer an example (-Fidelity and The Case of Two Datasets) that may be used in class to illustrate a specific IS healthcare ethical dilemma. Prepared with the knowledge of ethical problems in healthcare organizations, IS professionals can meaningfully contribute to the deliberations and resolutions of the problems that will emerge as more healthcare facilities employ EHRs.

Wave 3 is characterized by unique applications that result in extending the classroom in ways that result in a more current, active, and interactive learning environment. The authors’ conceptualization helps faculty and administrators better understand how they are currently using technology, identify barriers to wave 3 adop- tion behavior, and develop goals and create applications that will push faculty beyond using new technologies merely to support or mirror previous functions."

They do not have the cognitive ability to recognize their own level of skills and consequently are unaware of any need to change or develop those skills. Another explanation of the effect suggests that students are generally aware of their performance but consistently overestimate their abilities in a systematic fashion. This study examines these two hypotheses and finds no evidence that the overestimation was due to lack of cognitive competence.

Fox 3000 with metal oxide sensors, as well as an experimental EN made of Taguchi-type tin oxide sensors, were used in the experiments. Odor intensity measurement by sensory analysis and EN sensor response were obtained for samples of odorous compounds (n-butanol, CH3COCH3, and C2H5SH) and for binary mixtures of odorous compounds (n-butanol and CH3COCH3). Linear regression analysis and artificial neural networks (ANN) were used to establish a relationship between odor intensity and EN sensor responses. The results, suggest that large differences in sensor response to samples of equivalent odor intensity exist and that sensitivity to odorous compounds varies according to the type of sensors. A linear relationship between odor intensity and averaged sensor response was found to be appropriate for the EN based on conducting polymer sensors with a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.94 between calculated and measured odor intensity. However, the linear regression approach was shown to be inadequate for both ENs, which included metal oxide-type sensors. Very strong correlation (r = 0.99) between measured odor intensity and calculated odor intensity using the ANN developed were obtained for both commercial ENs. A weaker correlation (r = 0.84) was found for the experimental instrument, suggesting an insufficient number of sensors and/or not enough diversity in sensor responses. The results demonstrated the ability of ENs to measure odor intensity associated with simple mixtures of odorous compounds and suggest that ANN are appropriate to model the relationship between odor intensity measurement and EN sensor response"

One contentious issue has been the relationship between the evaluations and learning. If good instruction increases the amount of learning that takes place, then learning and the evaluations should be validly related to each other. A review of the literature shows that attempts to find such a nomological relationship has been complicated by practice, methodology, and interpretation. A meta-analysis of the literature shows that a small average relationship exists between learning and the evaluations but that the association is situational and not applicable to all teachers, academic disciplines, or levels of instruction. It is concluded that the more objectively learning is measured, the less likely it is to be related to the evaluations."

Yet marketing instruction remains heavily reliant on presenting content primarily through verbal cues such as written or spoken words. Without visual instruction, some students may be underperforming because of the inconsistency between teachers teaching styles and students learning styles. Because it has been suggested that some college students learn better from visual stimuli, an improved balance between verbal and visual techniques could offer significant learning benefits. This study investigates the use of visual summaries as an instructional technique for visual learners. Findings reveal that student performance on specific marketing topics and overall course satisfaction can be enhanced by combining visual summaries with more traditional instructional approaches. Pedagogical ideas are provided to help instructors use visual summaries in marketing education."

However, much of the extant literature emphasizes techniques tied to implementing critical thinking approaches, while questions exist regarding the processes by which students are influenced through participation in critical thinking pedagogies. This study merges attitudes, norms, and self-identity literature as a means of addressing the question of how students come to view themselves as critical thinkers. Specifically, the authors hypothesize that attitude strength should moderate the influence of attitudes on normative beliefs. Normative beliefs, in turn, are posited to mediate the influence of the Attitude Ã— Attitude Strength interaction on student self-identity as a critical thinker. Thus, students with strong and positive attitudes regarding critical thinking will have strong normative beliefs associated with the skill, and these beliefs, in turn, will affect self-identity as a critical thinker. Results, based on a sample of students participating in critical thinkingâ€”oriented classes, support these hypotheses. Findings hold implications for academics and future researchers attempting to understand how to effectively leverage critical thinking pedagogies in marketing classes."

Results from a path-analytic model support the view that the instructor plays a significant role in influencing students’ attitudes, perceived benefits, and work and grade equity concerns regarding group work. The research showed that students were more likely to have positive attitudes about group work if they had instructors who discussed group management issues (e.g., group dynamics) and used methods to evaluate individual performance within the group (e.g., peer evaluations). In addition, the findings indicate that in general, instructors are not doing enough to facilitate students’ group experiences."

One way in which MIS students can benefit from experiential learning occurs when organizations in some way sponsor curricular outcomes. Sponsorship can range from classroom visits during which company representatives can provide students with perspectives on the duties and responsibilities of currently available jobs at their firm to complete participation in a particular course, which could include the assignment of a project, assistance in presenting the concepts to be studied and providing feedback on the results. For organizations located at some distance from the university, participation is generally minimal and may occur only once per year during recruiting visits. In this age of technological advancement, there is a wealth of opportunity for practitioners to play a much larger role in education and bring their experience and techniques directly to the classroom, regardless of their geographical separation from the students. Inexpensive video links can create a virtual classroom that encourages participation by organizations to take advantage of these opportunities; however, the technology is only a means to an end, which is to enhance technical education within an experiential learning framework. This paper discusses the issues that may arise in implementing a virtual classroom and the application of experiential learning in a virtual classroom that can benefit students.

Students in marketing classes in two different universities were surveyed. They received an average of 37 texts per day and initiated about 16. More than 90% of the respondents reported receiving texts while in class and 86% reported texting someone from class. Even though students believed they could follow a lecture and text at the same time, respondents who did text within marketing classes received lower grades. Contrary to other research, texting frequency was generally unrelated to GPA. Implications for both pedagogical issues and research in marketing education are discussed."

More specifically, the research focuses on the impact of: (1) GPA-homogeneous (HO) and GPA-heterogeneous (HE) groups upon student satisfaction with group processes and (2) the impact on individual student performance in both group and nongroup assignments. Data obtained from fourteen HE and fourteen HO student groups, in four separate Legal Environment of Business classes consisting of a mix of Management, Marketing, Computer Information Systems, International Business, Financial Services, and Accounting majors, generated a number of significant results. The most surprising observations dealt with the behavior of low achievers whose individual grades showed substantial improvement after working in HO groups. Researchers who are assessing pedagogical methods which serve to engage a student’s active learning and motivation should find these results to be of interest. In addition, the beneficial impact on task and relationship behaviors observed in this study should provide solace or a sense of reward to the larger set of academicians, across disciplines, who attempt to impart realistic organizational skills to their classes."

Results indicate that women evaluate sales ethics scenarios as less ethical than males and that varying positions on these ethical frameworks partially explain the divergence. Results also imply that today’s sales educators should primarily emphasize moral idealism when teaching sales ethics. Ethical codes and situation-based frameworks can aid this effort. When teaching relativistic individuals, educators can supplement idealistic methods via the use of cognitive moral development frameworks."

The process of developing these learning strategies and the importance of these strategies has been widely researched, but there has been little empirical research into how the students are affected by online environments. This preliminary study focused on the relationship between the use of online resources and the students’ overall outcome in the subject. The data were collected from first year on-campus (n = 105) and distance education (n = 258) students after completing their introductory marketing subject. The data were analyzed using correlations, simple regression, and Tobit regression to assess online activity and student outcomes. The results indicate that the use of these online resources has a significant and positive effect on the students’ grade. This finding suggests students are incorporating online environments into their learning strategies, which results in higher grades. Moreover, in practical terms, the results imply that teachers can help facilitate student self-learning strategies by creating encouraging and resource-rich online environments."

Marketing educators also face pressure to incorporate sustainability into both the curriculum and practices such as assessment. This article outlines the development of an innovative computer-based marking tool, SuperMarkIt (SMI), which promotes sustainability. Using an action research method, this article reports the results of the sixth cycle of review and improvement with data gathered from both educators and students. Results support the improvements in sustainability achieved by using SMI. Educationally, students report improved feedback quality in areas such as timeliness, legibility, constructiveness, personalization, and detail. Economically, academics report major increases in feedback quantity, and students report reductions in time and cost. Environmentally... "

A significant amount of research exists that investigates the drivers of lecture attendance. However, those studies typically study single factors in an isolated manner, thus overestimating the importance of individual factors. This study contributes to the understanding of lecture attendance (and nonattendance) by including a range of factors that potentially affect lecture attendance simultaneously, thus accounting for possible interactions between factors and identifying the key drivers of lecture attendance. The study uses a survey among all students of an Australian university to compute a regression model with the probability of lecture attendance as the dependent variable. Results indicate that only four of the factors previously investigated are significant for marketing students (i.e., the difficulty of the subject, the quality of the lecture as perceived by the student, the quality of the student as indicated by his or her average mark, and the format of the lecture), which leaves little opportunity for Australian universities to improve attendance with simple measures. Instead, the data suggest that universities need to improve the quality of lectures to achieve better attendance levels."

There has been shown to be a negative relationship between hours worked and academic achievement in studies in the United States as well as the United Kingdom and Australia. There is, however, no research to the authorsâ€™ knowledge as to how the number of working hours affects student learning in groups, and whether students in groups with varying work patterns report better learning outcomes in groups where student working hours are similar. This study reports that overall, greater working hours decrease studentsâ€™ perceptions of the value and their experience of group work, and this occurs more with second- and third-year students. It also reveals that students studying in groups where there is a large proportion of students working more than 2 days a week displayed significantly more negative appraisals of their experience at the end of a project than their peers in groups where few students were working."

It has been noted in many previous studies that interest in a major and career significantly influences the student's choice of college major; indeed, in most studies, it is the strongest influence. Yet extant studies treat interest as a one-dimensional construct; in fact, interest is multi-dimensional, that is, it is comprised of many factors. This study examines the construct of interest and in particular the factors which contribute to vocational interest among business college majors. Using a sample of 452, it compares and contrasts the significant influences on vocational interest among two groups: MIS majors and non-MIS business majors. Findings indicate both similarities and differences between the two groups, leading to constructive recommendations for increasing interest in MIS with the intention of increasing the number of majors.

The course format utilizes active and deep learning to provide students with the ability to identify a marketing problem, select and use a strategic marketing tool or set of tools appropriate to its solution, collect and analyze relevant data, and make concrete data-based recommendations. Knowledge of the problem identification-to-recommendation process is enhanced via a ""learning spiral,"" which requires students to apply additional tools in different contexts, thus increasing their breadth and depth of understanding.

Unfortunately, both these methods have shortcomings. This article describes the segment manager method (SMM), a method for assigning individualized grades on the group project that does not rely on peer evaluations. A quasi-experiment is described where marketing research students are graded in groups either with peer evaluations (the control group) or with the SMM (the treatment group). Students participating in the quasi-experiment were more likely to prefer the SMM over the approach that uses peer evaluations. Moreover, when the SMM is compared with the peer evaluations approach, the SMM appears to be more likely to generate individualized grades on the group project that reflect each student's academic ability, to deter social loafing, to increase scores on the group project, and to increase scores on an exam that is heavily loaded with project material. Recommendations for future users of the SMM are offered. © The Author(s) 2012."

Sales curricula used within today’s marketing programs should include rigorous discussions of sales ethics. The Personal Selling Ethics Scale (PSE) provides an analytical tool for assessing and discussing students’ ethical sales sensitivities. However, since the scale fails to address many ethical issues within the personal selling process, it should be revised. The current research assessed the PSE’s content validity via a content analysis of today’s university sales texts, popular press sales books, and codes of ethics. Results of the content analysis were used to develop a revised scale (PSE-2) that includes new scenarios suggested by the literature search. A sample of 669 students was used to replicate the original study and test the revised PSE-2 and its new ethical scenarios. The updated scale offers marketing educators an effective tool by which to enhance sales ethics discussions."

By following this standard format, where discussion of qualitative research methods is usually limited to focus groups and depth interviews, academics are potentially penalizing students and their future employers by providing them with a restricted set of abilities. Are we producing a generation of future marketing managers who rather than embracing the possibilities for deep understanding will instead limit themselves to the mainstream? In the article the authors consider the value and viability of introducing ethnographic techniques into the marketing research curriculum to complement existing qualitative methods and provide four examples to demonstrate this. The authors do not negate the need for marketing courses to continue to teach students the ""basics"" of marketing research but rather challenge the idea that this archetype provides all the necessary skills. If marketing educators are to truly equip students for future roles as decision makers in business, the authors recommend that ethnography must be considered a viable alternative method of marketing research. © The Author(s) 2012."

Gradually, more attention is being paid to developing this generic competence as part of academic curricula, resulting in two questions: how to best promote team competencies and how to implement team projects successfully. These questions are closely interwoven and need to be looked at together. To address these questions, this paper identifies relevant studies and approaches, best practices, and key findings in the field of information systems education and related fields such as computer science and business, and examines them together to develop a systematic framework. The framework is intended to categorize existing research on teams and team competencies in information systems education and to guide information systems educators in supporting teamwork and promoting team competencies in students at the course and curricular level in the context of teaching in tertiary education.

An importance-performance analysis was carried out on these data. Findings indicate that the top current priority for practitioners is knowledge related to areas associated with measuring return-on-investment and strategic marketing. Results also support that meta-skills are perceived as high priorities for improvement, including the ability to creatively identify, formulate, and solve problems; the ability to write in a business environment; and the ability to set priorities. Some of the areas identified as lower priority in this study included design-related skills, production, and merchandising. Suggestions for changes to marketing education, future research, and considerations for practitioners are provided."

This article explores one such dynamic at both intra- and intergroup levels. Using data generated from multiple sources, it was identified that students who are actively contributing to group processes have difficulty distinguishing between students, and indeed groups, that are socially loafing and those that are genuinely struggling with the material. As a consequence, the struggling students are subject to incidences of socially destructive behaviors, critically harming their ability to develop. This has the potential to harm not only the individual struggling student and their group but also burden the other members of the class with a class member that will never be able to meaningfully contribute. Using social interdependence theory, a framework is proposed to explain how this confusion among contributing students arises. Recommendations are made regarding how to design curriculum so as to minimize the incidence of this phenomenon as well as intervention strategies to mitigate its effect should it present"

This paper describes a three-step approach for addressing these challenges. First, we have designed undergraduate and graduate information ethics courses that expand the range of learning of ethical theories beyond the traditional Western canon to include a wide spectrum of non-Western and feminist theories. Second, we have designed interactive cases for this course that adopt a collaborative learning approach where students work together in small groups by playing different roles that make interdependent decisions. Third, we deliver these cases via an educational simulation, making the approach scalable and transferable to other institutions across the country and around the world. The data for this study includes textual answers from end-of-semester questionnaires completed by 101 undergraduate and graduate students during four information ethics courses that included use of the simulation. Data was analyzed using thematic analysis, focusing on the multicultural and global dimensions of student learning. Five themes emerged from data collected in the four courses: Learning about a Diverse Range of Ethical Theories; Learning about how Ethical Theories are Related to Culture and Values; Relating International and Multicultural Dimensions to Understanding Oneself; Relating International and Multicultural Dimensions to Understanding Others; and Understanding the Role of Ethics and Culture in Information Systems Design and Use. Based on these results, the three-step approach developed in this study can be implemented across the country and around the world to ensure that students are prepared for the ethical challenges of a globalized world."

To date, academic research has been mainly devoted to the characteristics of instruction formats and their effectiveness, characteristics of the institutions (private, public, and/or religious affiliation), and the composition of the student body. Furthermore, the way business ethics is taught in MBA programs around the world has been influenced by recommendations of accreditation agencies and professional bodies. Against this background, this article aims to contrast these findings and recommendations with perceptions and expectations of experienced managers studying in part-time MBA programs. By means of 30 in-depth interviews conducted with MBA students of various nationalities studying at a well-known European business school, this research sheds light on an important but neglected perspective in the discussion surrounding ethics education, namely students' opinions. Findings indicate that exchange with others and integration within the respective business discipline is particularly important in gaining acceptance and instilling relevance in ethics education for this target group.

Kano questionnaires were handed out to 104 undergraduate students at a university in the Southwest and to 147 undergraduate students at a university in the Midwest of the USA. The two resulting Kano maps show the same delighting attributes while other satisfaction attributes are also similar. The findings reveal the importance of the personality of professors and the characteristics of professors which: a) are desired by students, b) are not desired by students, c) impact student satisfaction the most, d) impact satisfaction the least. The results also demonstrate how professors and universities can focus attention on those attributes most likely to influence satisfaction. No attributes of professors are classified as basic or taken for granted factors by students, while three attributes are excitement factors that have the potential to delight students. The findings illustrate that there is a set of multiple attributes that professors need to possess for satisfying studentprofessor classroom service encounters. Student populations appear to show strong similarities in their preferences for characteristics of professors that lead to satisfaction and dissatisfaction outcomes."

Furthermore, they report on both the methods they recommend for small and large retailers and the tech- niques they believe small and large retailers use. The favorite budgeting technique among academics is the objective and task. Academics reflect this as (1) establishing advertising objectives, (2) determining tasks to achieve specified objec- tives, (3) determining costs for each of these tasks, and (4) totaling the costs. The authors maintain that the implementa- tion of the objective and task approach requires the use of methods of both prioritizing alternative expenditures and set- ting a cutoff point. These points are often neglected by aca- demics, including textbook writers, when defining the approach. Furthermore, for the most part, a combination of techniques should be used when implementing an objective and task method.

Although business education researchers have begun to study rapport, past research has principally focused on students' perceptions of rapport, whereas faculty's perceptions of rapport have never been studied or contrasted with those of students. Understanding this is critical as rapport between faculty and students can improve learning and bestow other positive student and faculty benefits. Employing qualitative research, this study uncovers faculty's views of the antecedents and outcomes of rapport between faculty and students. Based on the results of this study, a faculty-student model of rapport is developed. This model shows that approach, personality, and homophily factors serve as antecedents to such rapport. Student benefits such as enhanced learning, greater involvement, and greater customization are important outcomes of rapport. Other outcomes include faculty benefits, outside-of-the-classroom benefits, as well as benefits for both faculty--students. Contrasts to past research and recommendations for faculty to build rapport are presented."

Although the basic skills (i.e., critical thinking, communication) recruiters seek have not changed much from previous studies, recruiters rated critical thinking skills, such as problem solving, much higher than either faculty or students. Graduates must be accountable and show the impact and rationale behind decisions. In other words, educators must continue to stress reading, writing, and “arith-metrics.” The lessons learned herein include ways to engage students, strengthen communication skills, incorporate skill development workshops, use professional speakers in marketing organizations, and promote services available outside the classroom as well as help students develop multiple skill sets in class. Educators should also encourage students to be open-minded, creative, and explore opportunities including internships and positions that may not be their current career choice. Finally, educators should discuss pros and cons of going straight through school or working before attending graduate school."

Following this, a series of ethnographic EL snapshots, collected between 1991 and 2010, are used to develop a continuum of learner disengagement. This continuum includes academically challenged, ambivalent, and formulaic learners. Of these, it is the formulaic learner who presents the greatest threat to EL. This is a discerning and discriminating learner who wishes to be in control of his or her own achievements and who sees EL activities as a threat to his or her success. Practical ways of responding to the changing EL landscape are proposed. These proposals include moving away from a linear learning experience, embracing EL projects that capitalize on learner technological capabilities, and reviewing the timing and conditions within which EL activities are situated."

The aim was to determine if marketing attracts individuals who have a greater predisposition to unethical behaviors given that marketing is often reported as the most unethical of all business activities. The Defining Issues Test (DIT) was used to measure MRA. Although frequently used to measure the MRA of undergraduate students, the DIT has not been used within the marketing domain. The findings indicate that marketing students do not exhibit a lower level of MRA than other business disciplines. Marketing students are no less ethical in their thinking than those pursuing other business careers. The perception of unethical behavior is more likely to be a product of the visible nature of marketing activities to consumers."

Fisher’s model of significance testing, where the evidential p value denotes the level of significance, nevertheless dominates statistical testing practice. This paradox has occurred because these two incompatible theories of classical statistical testing have been anonymously mixed together, creating the false impression of a single, coherent model of statistical inference. We show that this hybrid approach to testing, with its misleading p < a statistical significance criterion, is common in marketing research textbooks, as well as in a large random sample of papers from twelve marketing journals. That is, researchers attempt the impossible by simultaneously interpreting the p value as a Type I error rate and as a measure of evidence against the null hypothesis. The upshot is that many investigators do not know what our most cherished, and ubiquitous, research desideratum—“statistical significance”—really means. This, in turn, signals an educational failure of the first order. We suggest that tests of statistical significance, whether p’s or a’s, be downplayed in statistics and marketing research courses. Classroom instruction should focus instead on teaching students to emphasize the use of confidence intervals around point estimates in individual studies, and the criterion of overlapping confidence intervals when one has estimates from similar studies."

The study found that student learning increased when multiple experiential techniques were used relative to learning that occurred when a single experiential technique was combined with a lecture format. In addition, the data suggest that the use of multiple experiential techniques also influenced the type of information students learned."

That said, the ways in which VWs can be implemented into the teaching curriculum are many and varied. This article reports on two studies in which notionally similar graduate classes are taught about marketing in Second Life (SL). The degree of student and instructor immersion is intentionally varied: One class is taught entirely in SL, by a technically expert instructor, while novice/intermediate instructors teach the second class in an interactive tutorial setting. Taken together, these studies offer marketing educators insights into developing ""full"" and ""lite"" approaches to teaching in SL, thereby lowering the barrier to uptake of the technology by catering to a broader spectrum of both instructor and student competencies, interests, and abilities.

Cheating is rampant on college campuses. Following a review of the state of academic integrity at colleges and universities, this article then explores the reasons for rising dishonesty on campuses. Using microeconomic analysis of academic dishonesty, including discussion of the externalities that drive college students to cheat, the article provides new insights into deterrence and prevention. Using their Arizona State University (ASU) experience vis-a-vis academic honesty, and in combination with economic theory, the authors present a means for curbing or at least motivating attitudinal changes toward cheating in both the current culture and higher education. They present their microeconomic analysis on cheating and provide data on current student views, as reflected in the responses by over a thousand ASU undergraduates, with regard to academic dishonesty. Then, the authors provide a discussion of the six resolutions proposed by the Student-Faculty Policy Committee and passed by the ASU Faculty Senate in spring 2005. The article concludes with a discussion of the nature of cheating today as compared to the past, and offers insights into what the future may hold in terms of both academic dishonesty and institutional responses.

Industrial Management","This article seeks to address how marketing academics can best serve marketing practice through marketing education. It is contended that, where technology is driving marketing in practice, it is afforded significantly less attention in both theory and education. Thus, the marketing graduates being produced from universities are often lacking in the skills that 21st-century marketers require. Where the focus of the article is on marketing education, a broad analysis of the content of marketing textbooks and degree programs is presented and an “old Marketing DNA” presented. The study also adopted an inductive approach to data collection where the aim was to investigate the exact nature, constituency, and role of marketing in organizations. Qualitative in-depth interviews were undertaken with senior marketing managers and executives in U.K. organizations. Findings are organized into the areas of customer-led marketing, value-driven strategic marketing, channels, data-driven marketing, and online and off-line integrated marketing communications. The article concludes that there is a disconnect between marketing education and marketing practice and goes some way to recommending what the response of marketing academia should be through the “new Marketing DNA.” This article aims to inspire a holistic response from marketing educators to bring their practice more in line with what is actually being practiced by marketing practitioners in the 21st century."

Brand advocacy in products and services has played a vital role in marketing. However, no known research to date has embraced the idea of brand advocacy in marketing education. This research builds on the recent human brand relationship literature and examines the mediating effects of attachment strength and relationship factors on professor brand advocacy. Survey data gathered from 228 marketing students and the empirical findings suggest that when professors are responsive to their students innate needs of relatedness and competence, students form strong attachments to the professors. Furthermore, strong students attachments to professors influence students trust and satisfaction in their professors. These trusting and satisfying relationships determine the willingness of the students to advocate the professor brands. The authors discuss the implications for marketing educators."

In the online environment, technology mediates learning: it mediates communications and information transfer between the student and the instructor, between the student and the content, and among the students. Critics fear that the lack of face-to-face, personal contact with the instructor and other students creates a remoteness that inhibits learning. The purpose of this article is to describe and analyze two online legal environment courses to determine whether the instructor successfully used technology to create an effective online teaching and learning environment. The central focus is on the concept of ""teaching presence"" in physical and online environments and how teaching presence can be created in an online environment. Part I of the article begins by discussing trends in online education, explaining tools used to promote learning in the online environment, defining education, and summarizing theories of teaching and learning. This part also examines the lecture as a method of teaching and promoting learning. In Part II, the author discusses the role of the teacher and the concept of teaching presence. This part also comprehensively describes the author's online courses, one graduate and one undergraduate, which were designed to convey a sense of teaching presence. Finally, Part III reports and evaluates the results of student surveys conducted to confirm whether the author, as the instructor, was present in these online courses. The article concludes with recommendations for ensuring teaching presence in online courses. (Contains 8 tables and 69 footnotes.)"

Therefore, higher marketing education emphasizes creativity in several ways. However, assessing creativity and creative problem solving is challenging and tools for this purpose have not been developed in the context of marketing education. To address this gap, we analyze the use of Structure of the Observed Learning Outcome (SOLO) taxonomy as an assessment tool in creative problem solving and in doing so develop an assessment framework by contextualizing SOLO taxonomy for client-based marketing development projects. We first introduce earlier literature on assessment and SOLO taxonomy. We then describe a client-based marketing course on creative problem solving. We use SOLO taxonomy to analyze the outcomes and development processes of six student projects and in doing so develop an assessment framework for creative problem solving. Finally, we give suggestions for teachers on how to enhance creative problem solving and its assessment in marketing classrooms. © The Author(s) 2013."

This research proposes a model that investigates the relationships among motivation, effort, personality, stress, and academic performance. Action-state orientation (AO-SO) is an important factor in students’ emotional exhaustion and effort. AO-SO relates to individual differences in the capacity to regulate emotions, cognitions, and behaviors to accomplish intentional actions. AO-SO consists of three dimensions: disengagement (versus preoccupation), volatility (versus persistency), and hesitation (versus initiative). Results indicate that persistency and initiative are positively related to effort, which is an important antecedent of academic performance. Also, disengagement is negatively related to emotional exhaustion. (Contains 1 fig"

Over the years, advertising education has developed from vocational-based courses to degree courses across the country. This study uses diffusion theory and various secondary sources and interviews to observe the development of advertising education in Australia from its early past to its current-day tertiary offerings, to discussing the issues that are arising in the near future. Six critical issues are identified, along with observations about the challenges and opportunities within Australian advertising education. By looking back to the future, it is hoped that this historical review provides lessons for other countries of similar educational structure or background, or even other marketing communication disciplines on a similar evolutionary path.

The majority of student responses fell within Carroll's CSR categories, with the heaviest emphasis on Ethical and Legal responsibilities, a lighter emphasis on Economic responsibility, and the lightest emphasis on discretionary responsibility. Students exhibited ""message myopia"" in that they largely focused their comments on the creation of advertisements and to the exclusion of environmentalism; client, vendor, and employee relations; diversity or community involvement.

Results from the survey responses of 227 students at eight universities suggest that a high-investment strategy of catering intensively to learning style individual differences is not warranted.

When people are unable to judge their own achievement, they are in a double bind; they have neither a particular skill nor the cognitive ability to realize their own level of incompetence. If students are unaware of their poor performance on tests, they are unlikely to realize their limitations. Correspondingly, the high performers may not recognize their ability to be successful. This study tests students' self-recognized competence by having them estimate the grade they expected to receive on a test immediately following its completion. Poorer students significantly overestimated their performance; better students underestimated their performance. Poorer students became better estimators over time, while there was no similar improvement in better students' self-assessments."

Reaction to this innovative approach has been extremely positive, with very high course evaluations and comments praising the value of literature as a learning laboratory that provided an understanding and appreciation of these issues.

An incremental learning framework is proposed that allows instructors to develop and monitor content-specific theory and the corresponding critical thinking skills. Structured exercises are used initially to examine theory and augment critical thinking skills. The degree of structure decreases progressively as students develop these skills and master theory. The process culminates in traditional (unstructured) case analysis. This discussion explores the characteristics and benefits of structured case analysis and describes how the method can be implemented in a marketing case course. The incremental learning framework fosters metacognition and task generalization.

An online survey was conducted with 288 participants using the critical incident approach. Results indicate that predictors of intention to complain differ based on the target of complaint behavior (school, friends, or unknown others) and the mode of complaint (in person or using the web). Specifically, the more dissatisfied students are, the more likely they are to complain to the school and to friends either in person or using the web but not to unknown others. Students complain to the school only if the effort involved is minimal and they believe the school will respond. Students complain to friends and unknown others in person if they feel the school will respond to negative press. Personal characteristics also influence intentions to complain. Students with a propensity to complain broadcast their negative experience via the web, grade conscious students tell their friends but only in person, and heavy social media users inform their friends using the web. Implications for faculty and administrators are discussed. (Contains 1 figure and 5 tables.)"

Presented next are the results of three studies. The first study examines qualitative feedback gathered from students and evaluates several benefits and drawbacks associated with using SMGs. A second study uses an experimental design to test the effects of SMGs on anticipated motivation across different class types. Finally, the third study reports feedback from professors to gauge their reactions to the SMG process. Research implications and suggestions for implementing SMGs are also discussed."

Current concepts in undergraduate business education, such as ethics and sustainability, must also be included in one's classrooms. Some texts highlight issues with landmark cases or feature articles about businesses that have experienced high-profile legal and/or ethical dilemmas. Using high-profile cases and newsworthy business situations are useful in stimulating discussions. However, professors often struggle with keeping students engaged while in the classroom. Real-world examples in the classroom have the best pedagogical value because of their appeal to traditional college students. This article features TerraCycle, Inc., a business that can portray many of the legal principles taught in a Legal Environment of Business course, and this business is interesting to students. This business and its actual litigation with a competitor, coupled with hypothetical legal issues faced by typical businesses, can be used as a basis for discussion for the entire semester to illustrate many of the principles of a typical Legal Environment of Business course. Although this semester-long case study focused on this particular start-up business, any business of interest to students can be used. The authors discuss how to connect TerraCycle, Inc. to students and how it can be utilized for lessons in the classroom. (Contains 3 figures and 28 footnotes.)"

In this article, the authors describe a semester-long, team-based retail audit project that is structured to elicit active student engagement with consumer behavior course material via concrete, hands-on, real-world experience. For the project, students form teams to organize and conduct an observational audit of a live retail setting. In the process of completing the project, students engage with course content on their own, with their team members, and importantly, within a focal store environment, thus experiencing for themselves the effects of that content on their own shopping behavior, as well as that of others. Compelled by the project’s active pedagogy to engage in discovery, students learn not only the “what” and “why” of marketing concepts, strategies, and techniques but also “how to” implement them. Anchored in conceptual perspectives relevant to the project, the article explains the components and structure of the project and explicates its key benefits with an emphasis on the students’ perspectives. The article includes results of qualitative and quantitative analyses that support the effectiveness of the project and suggests future directions for extending pedagogical research in this area.

It differs significantly from previous studies, which focus on integrating service learning into existing marketing courses and on helping local nonprofit organizations. The focus of the course outlined in this article is on strengthening marketing-related competencies acquired through earlier coursework; developing broader work-related competencies, such as cross-functional thinking, teamwork, communication, and cultural sensitivity; and operating a collegiate chapter of a nonprofit engaged in international community service. The course described is well aligned with other significant trends in undergraduate business education: it is multidisciplinary, it emphasizes collaborative learning, it is founded on carefully articulated learning outcomes, and learning success is assessed. It provides a transformational experience and prepares students for a global and diverse workplace. A framework for course design is presented, and a set of pedagogical materials is provided that other marketing educators can use to develop and launch a significant international, multidisciplinary community service learning course.

In-class simulations can serve to develop the all-important critical thinking skills that educated people are expected to possess in today's complex legal environment. Moot court exercises, also known as appellate argumentation or appellate simulation, can be just as effective as mock trials and simulated hearings in teaching skills to students. Law schools, many of which utilize a moot court as part of their regular curriculum, find that it provides students with the opportunity to sharpen their writing skills, to polish their oral presentation skills, and to help them think more carefully about the interplay between factual contexts and legal principles. A moot court, like a mock trial, also ""brings excitement into the classroom and stimulates interest in and appreciation for America's system of justice."" In this article, the author discusses the importance of using appellate simulations in a business law course. He also identifies some obstacles to conducting a realistic and meaningful appellate simulation in a business school setting and describes ways on how to overcome these obstacles.

However, there is evidence in the literature that marketing academics focus more on and are more competent in research than teaching. This imbalance, in a majority of instances, can be traced back to doctoral education. Doctoral programs in marketing are designed to prepare students for becoming successful marketing professors. An important component of becoming a successful professor is learning how to teach effectively. Yet doctoral programs fall short of providing adequate pedagogical training. Consequently, marketing educators, from their doctoral days through their professorial careers, have a responsibility to continuously work on their competence in teaching. However, how can marketing educators in general and marketing doctoral students in particular develop pedagogical competence (PC)? In this article, the authors deconstruct PC into five components: content knowledge (or knowledge of subject matter), knowledge of pedagogical approaches, course management capability, classroom management capability, and student management capability. Next, they discuss how individuals can develop PC and the implications of PC for marketing education. Specifically, the authors discuss issues and implications for doctoral students, doctoral programs, marketing departments, and marketing faculty. Finally, the authors conclude with a discussion of the contributions of the article to marketing academe."

How these issues are addressed will, of course, depend on the instructor, the course, the level of the students, and the time available during the course to discuss the issues. Whether ethical issues in marketing are introduced as part of an existing class discussion, as a separate weekly subject topic, or as an entirely dedicated course, we recognize that it can be difficult to get students actively engaged and involved. In this paper, we present an alternative and interactive in-class exercise using group analysis and discussion of imagery and symbolism-understood as a reflection of public sentiment-in political cartoons. We introduce theories of cartoon analysis as social commentary, describe the exercise and methods, and then illustrate an example of the exercise as conducted with our own students. We conclude by noting the method's limitations and considering alternative pedagogical applications of the analytical framework.

This article argues that a deeper understanding of diverse cultural student groups is important for Australian and other universities that wish to differentiate their education service offerings by customizing them to different segments. International and domestic students are commonly seen to have different learning style preferences. This study empirically explores whether an understanding of culturally anchored values provides a better customer segmentation measure to predict learning style preferences than existing domestic and international student measures. Three questions are empirically addressed: Do business students' culturally anchored values explain variation in learning style preferences? Do students' culturally anchored values predict a preference for a more student- or teacher-driven learning environment? and Can an understanding of culturally anchored values provide a better customer segmentation variable to identify learning style preferences than the more commonly used categories of domestic and international? This study found that culturally anchored values provided stronger predictors of learning style preferences than domestic and international student categorizations. Implications for marketing undergraduate business programs are identified.

Given the growth in sales education at colleges and universities, firms are looking to recruit their frontline marketing and sales personnel direct from college. Thus, there is an opportunity for marketing educators to influence these future marketing and sales professionals’ attitudes toward technology via course instruction. This study combines technology-mediated learning and technology acceptance theories in the marketing sales education domain to show how two different contextual learning modes affected marketing and sales students’ perceptions of technology. A total of 252 marketing/sales students from an Account and Territory Management class were taught to use a salesforce automation tool using two different contextual learning approaches. Findings showed that when students were taught using an approach involving a realistic sales scenario, their perceptions of technology usefulness were greater than if the course instruction was delivered using a systematic task-based learning approach. This supports the view that the learning context of technology training matters. For students of marketing and sales, the implication is the development of perceptions that make them more willing to use technology in the workplace. "

After reviewing past research and using exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis suggests the existence of five latent variables in student evaluations: organization, workload/difficulty, expected/fairness of grading, instructor liking/concern, and perceived learning. Next, adding structural paths, these variables are used to model the formation of student evaluations. The models developed demonstrate that student evaluations may lack discriminant validity, the extent to which a measure does not correlate with other constructs it is not supposed to measure (e.g., expected/fairness of grading does have a large impact on ratings of teaching ability). Moreover, the use of student evaluations is compounded by the common usage of global measures in student evaluation practice. Here, the use of overall course value and instructor rating are contrasted. The results are disparate, raising questions about the use of summative measures (i.e., of what should they be composed, if used at all)."

Without access to the usual verbal and nonverbal cues, instructors in these megaclasses are disadvantaged in terms of their ability to respond to learners needs. As a result, marketing instructors have supplemented course infrastructure with technology to encourage communication. In seeking to better understand such communication, this study positions netnography as a marketing research technique that provides incremental advantages over other pedagogical methods through its support and enhancement of student learning. The authors provide specific recommendations for the adoption of netnography to marketing educators teaching megaclasses."

Little research exists in the marketing education literature on the role student organizations play in preparing their members for life beyond school. Understanding what students seek as members of such organizations and how satisfied they are with their experiences is not only important for continued chapter development but also useful for faculty not directly involved with such organizations but impacted by their activities. A model, developed and tested through a large-scale study of American Marketing Association collegiate members, suggests four experiential dimensions affect member satisfaction and professional development - strategic and tactical activities, interpersonal and networking skills, entrepreneurial and venture experience, and applied learning through contacts with professionals. Recommendations for improving American Marketing Association chapters are presented. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]"

Research regarding the relationship between specific cultural measures and academic honesty is sparse in the context of marketing and business programs in higher education. This study surveys marketing and business college students from 13 different countries about their perceptions of questionable behaviors concerning academic honesty and measures Hofstede’s commonly studied cultural dimension of individualism/ collectivism as a direct test of the cultural hypotheses presented. As predicted, collectivist business students are more tolerant than individualist business students concerning questionable academic behaviors that are unilateral (e.g., copying material/ papers from the Internet or looking at another student’s exam without the knowledge of the other student), collaborative (e.g., getting exam questions/answers from others or free riding in a group), and delaying (e.g., requesting due date/exam date delays or assignment extensions with false information). In alignment with the theory of reasoned action, results also show that a positive attitude about the value of teamwork (relative to individual work) mediates the effect between collectivism and questionable academic behaviors that are collaborative. The results and recommendations are particularly relevant to marketing educators teaching beginners to advanced courses in a culturally diverse classroom."

Group projects are one tool that educators can use to help students develop these key skills. Educators may be tempted to try client-based projects in which students consult with real companies, an approach that may involve extensive preparation for the faculty member, or opt instead for a less labor-intensive option, such as having students work on hypothetical problems for established companies. Faculty must decide what type of project will most benefit their students and, at the same time, will not be too complex to administer. In this article the authors discuss literature regarding group projects using real world clients (client-based learning) and they empirically test whether the nature of the project has any influence on how the students perceive the project as a motivational tool, a learning device, and a contributor to their skill development, and the personal benefits they receive from completing the project. Understanding these issues will help instructors to better design and administer group projects. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)"

My teaching philosophy is centered on the creation of an interactive learning environment. This encompasses problem-based teaching and collaborative learning to foster discussions between students and between faculty members and students. This setting is largely supported by the creation of technological resources and the design of feedback systems. Feedback provides students with the opportunity to gauge their understanding of the course and to improve. The technological resources assist students to learn at their own pace. Consisting of digital lecture recordings, an on-line tutor, and a ""bank"" of lecture slides and assessment materials, these online resources serve to provide students with feedback and 24-hr support to assist with their learning. Variety in teaching tools, the creation of an interactive and supportive environment, and the implementation of high standards have motivated my students to attend class and excel in their performance.

In a student-centered learning environment, the instructor ideally serves primarily as a learning resource or facilitator. With the guidance of the instructor, students in active learning environments strive for higher-level cognitive skills that effectively develop written and oral communication abilities and critical thinking and reasoning skills. Faculty members who wish to incorporate active learning strategies into their law courses must be mindful of the diverse learning styles found in the classroom. Instructors must employ pedagogical methods that reach out to a broad range of learning styles in their efforts to promote student-centered learning and upper-level cognitive skills. Collaborative learning groups integrated with productive technological tools can further strengthen student-centered learning and bridge the gap between different learning styles. A major obstacle to legal studies faculty seeking to achieve these varied learning goals in an undergraduate law course may be the lack of appropriate classroom materials. This article summarizes the major learning domains and reviews higher-level cognitive skills under Bloom's Taxonomy in a legal education context. The importance of active learning and the various types of learning styles found in undergraduate law classes are also addressed. The article then provides the materials for an online dispute resolution (ODR) simulation, ""The Case of the Unhappy Sports Fan,"" and a student reflection paper for a team evaluation of the simulation exercise. These exercises offer student-centered learning opportunities aimed at enhancing upper-level cognitive skills and attuned to different student learning styles. The assignment materials allow for collaborative work outside of class and lead to interesting class discussions about the online learning experience during class time. Two different undergraduate law courses, Cyberlaw and Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) in Business, have successfully used the online simulation and reflection paper, which could be easily replicated in other undergraduate law courses.

Can professors use Twitter to engage students in conversation about a marketing course? The authors argue that Twitter has many benefits for marketing educators who are interested in engaging students in experiential learning. In a real-time environment for student learning, professors may use Twitter for direct communication with students to generate discussion and interest in the course topics and examples. Just as marketers use Twitter to generate interest, discussion, and brand image, educators can use Twitter to generate this interest in a course through social media. Furthermore, Twitter is a fast, easy method for making announcements, solving student issues, and performing course-related administrative duties. In three studies, both quantitative and qualitative data suggest that when students engage in Twitter use with the professor, students feel better prepared for future careers. In addition, students indicate that Twitter facilitates achieving traditional educational goals. The qualitative data offer insights into potential problems. Suggestions for educators interested in using Twitter are offered."

Continued double-digit growth in buying power and consumption among the world's poor appear certain, provided that the subsistence merchants serving such markets are effective. Ensuring such effectiveness, however, demands the training of millions of such marketers, which in turn requires the development of pedagogical approaches that take into account their unique capabilities, characteristics, and orientation. The article begins with a brief review of the historical record of transformation in marketing education in response to market changes, and then moves into a detailed description of subsistence merchants and the challenges they present to contemporary marketing education practices. Focus then shifts to the Marketplace Literacy Project (MLP) and its evolving methodologies for teaching marketing to subsistence merchants in India. The article concludes with takeaways from Marketplace Literacy Project's efforts that are generalizable to other subsistence contexts and serve to inspire marketing educators to devote energy and resources to improving marketing effectiveness among the global poor. © The Author(s) 2012."

A census of marketing programs in degree-granting universities was con- ducted. Program brochures were obtained via the Internet and were content analyzed. This study reports a lower proportion of universities requiring students to take a course dedicated to society and environmental issues than previous studies have. Only 27% of universities in Australia required students to take a dedicated ethics, social responsibility, and/or sustainability course. Only 8% of universities offered a dedicated core marketing ethical or social responsibility course. Previous sample estimates may have overstated ethical, social responsibility, and sustainability course requirements. There is considerable room for improvement in Australia and New Zealand if universities are to equip their students with the skills, knowledge, and ideas to benefit themselves, the organizations they choose to work for, and society as a whole.

Subsequently, they are less resource intensive from a universityâ€™s perspective. This article details an experiential second-year marketing course that requires students to develop real products and services to sell on two organized market days. In the course, students participate as both consumers and marketers in a simulated world. The current article explores the effectiveness of this experiential assessment in terms of its ability to engage students. Comparing student engagement to a traditional lecture course and National Survey of Student Engagement benchmarks, the results suggest that the use of a simulated marketplace is capable of engaging students. Specifically, the assessment reported encourages more active learning and collaboration, is more academically challenging, and permits more studentâ€”faculty interaction than a traditional lecture-based course. The course structure outlined in this article permits the dynamics of a live marketing environment to be introduced into the classroom.

This study investigates several beliefs and values, opportunism, and certain demographic variables that might contribute to the academic dishonesty of American and Chinese marketing students. The findings suggest that American marketing students who are young, tolerant, detached, relativistic, less religious, opportunistic, and negative tend to believe that academic dishonesty is more acceptable than do their counterparts exhibiting the opposite characteristics. Chinese marketing students who are male, detached, relativistic, less religious, opportunistic, and behaviorist oriented tend to perceive that academic dishonesty is more acceptable than do their counterparts. The results also reveal that the Chinese marketing students are more tolerant and detached than are the American marketing students, and they are less sensitive to the acceptance of academic dishonesty than are the American students.

The authors assess which of three class formats (i.e., 1 hour/three times a week, 1[1/2] hours/twice a week, or 3 hours/one time a week) is optimal in terms of student (a) perspectives, (b) grades, and (c) evaluations of instructor performance. The authors observed that regardless of major, students prefer the twice a week class format, and marketing majors had the strongest preference for that format. All students believed the once a week format would result in lower levels of learning. Instructors teaching in the twice a week format received higher evaluations from students. And finally, there appears to be slightly better student grade performance in shorter classes, especially evident with marketing majors attending the twice a week format."

Yet academic literature and the popular press provide evidence that in some cases, service providers act as discriminatory agents toward their own customers. Likewise, other customers in the servicescape can negatively influence a customer's service quality experience. This article attempts to address shortcomings in services marketing textbooks and classroom discussions by providing educators with a multicultural service sensitivity exercise that they can employ in undergraduate, graduate, and executive MBA courses. The article offers educators an easy-to-implement, active learning exercise that shows students how many consumers fail to obtain quality service in the marketplace. The goal of the exercise is to help students develop an appreciation for diversity and understand how to manage a service setting so that all customers receive optimal service quality.

Students researching on the Internet do not have to take handwritten or typewritten notes. They can simply print out or copy and save whatever they find. They are even spared the tedium of having to retype the material that they have accessed; today's students can simply copy and paste the material into their assignments. Also, a number of companies, easily accessed online, provide finished research papers for students on business and law-related topics for a fee, which, if utilized, can substitute for doing any work at all. As a result, the age-old problem of plagiarism is exacerbated by the ease and availability of the copying. This article first reviews the importance of helping legal studies students improve their written communication through written assignments, despite the problem of plagiarism. The article argues that students need more education about plagiarism. It looks at definitions of plagiarism and considers typical problems legal studies students may have with plagiarism. The article then suggests faculty strategies for structuring assignments to avoid plagiarism in student assignments. (Contains 53 footnotes.)"

Seven main constructs known to influence Teaching Effectiveness have been variously selected for inclusion in previous literature; however, previous multivariate studies have examined only a subset of these constructs, with the majority considering four or fewer constructs. The comprehensive model of Teaching Effectiveness developed in this study examines the main and mediated influence of all seven constructs on Teaching Effectiveness. Data have been collected from undergraduate marketing students. Three constructs (Clear Communication, Delivery Dynamism, and Assessment Fairness) contribute directly to Teaching Effectiveness. Real-World Knowledge, Rapport, Subject Organization, and Subject Difficulty contribute indirectly to Teaching Effectiveness. Consistent with previous research, these findings highlight the importance of personal attributes (communication, delivery, real-world knowledge, and rapport) on Teaching Effectiveness."

This class typically aims to integrate and apply previously learned material and to transition students into their careers. Drawing on the professional school, creative problem solving and constructivist learning literature, this article describes a unique client-sponsored project capstone patterned after the popular television show, The Apprentice. Student teams accomplish a series of four challenges and their grades partially depend on actual results or the teams’ competitive rankings as judged by clients. There are no exams, lectures, and little assigned reading in this class: Instead, students must determine what they need to learn in order to solve each challenge and the instructor serves as coach and learning facilitator. The class engages and motivates students by providing real-world problems in a short time frame, and develops their creative problem solving, presentation, time management, and team work skills. Although cases and simulations can increase creative problem-solving skills, client-sponsored projects are more easily framed in the ambiguous manner needed to stimulate creative thinking. This article describes the class in detail, outlining sample projects and discussing some of the challenges with client-sponsored projects.

Significant differences were found in the social styles of different business majors. Furthermore, one’s major interacted with his or her gender to have a significant effect on the student’s social style. Students relied on cues both inside and outside the classroom to determine a professor’s social style. They were fairly accurate in guessing a professor’s level of assertiveness and responsiveness and, to a lesser extent, a professor’s specific social style. Students’ social styles and specific majors had a significant effect in preferences for specific faculty chosen as “favorites.” Recommendations are included on how marketing professors can develop a classroom persona to minimize personality conflicts in courses containing a mix of business majors."

The purpose of this research is to begin the exploration of marketing faculty perceptions about, and problems with, student evaluations of teaching and perceived efforts to influence the measure.

In Experiment 1, 345 undergraduate students were exposed to the framework using one of four conditions: control, verbal repetition, acronym, and verbal repetition plus acronym in a traditional learning setting. Students were tested for unaided recall of the concepts as well as concept application and analysis. Results indicate that using acronyms increased student scores at 2 weeks and 3 months for both unaided recall and analysis, but verbal repetition had no significant effect, either alone or in conjunction with the acronym. Experiment 2 tested the impact of acronym use in an active learning setting. Here, 129 undergraduate students were exposed to the framework using only an active learning method or the active learning method plus an acronym. Students were tested for unaided recall and concept application and analysis at 2 weeks and 3 months after exposure. Use of the acronym increased scores for both unaided recall and concept application and analysis compared to the active learning method alone. Implications for teaching strategies are discussed.

Recognizing the challenges of developing and running complex student projects, the authors extend theory to propose that the experience of reciprocal interdependence between team members enhances student integration learning and that reciprocal interdependence can be decoupled from project complexity. At the individual level, reciprocal interdependence is an interpersonal experience that can develop even in noncomplex tasks. Integration learning can therefore occur even in unrealistic, abstract, short-run student team project assignments. This matters because it gives educators additional options for structuring student project team assignments to generate the desired learning outcomes. The authors find support for the proposed theory by comparing data from abstract student projects to data from realistic student projects and real-life product development projects."

To explore the possibility that imagined outcomes--prompted by anticipated emotions-and select cognitive factors antecede cheating intentions, the authors developed and tested a model that relates anticipated regret, anticipated elation, locus of control, and personal expertise to willingness to cheat. The empirical results, which rely on five extant scales and a new multiitem vignette measure of cheating intentions, validate this deal-process model. Also, the results show that anticipated elation is a source of value for students, which positively affects their willingness to cheat.

Social enterprise programs and competitions are often offered outside the school of business and target students from a variety of academic backgrounds. Although social enterprises use business skills to solve social problems, the specific marketing skills required differ from those covered in most marketing curricula. This article recommends some changes in emphasis and/or scope to specific areas in the marketing curriculum and includes an outline of the proposed marketing curriculum for social enterprise programs.

Student expectations and institutional accountability standards are rising with regard to the quality of instruction. Research and publication pressures continue to increase as colleges and universities seek to competitively differentiate themselves in the eyes of multiple stakeholders. At a minimum, today's faculty members are expected to demonstrate effectiveness in both teaching and research. Earning tenure, promotion, and above-average merit pay requires excellence in both domains. Much has changed in the past 15 years, and an updated examination of teaching excellence is warranted. This article finds that many of the fundamentals associated with master teaching 15 years ago remain the same today: strong communication skills, use of an interactive style, and asking thought-provoking questions. One major new characteristic, use of technology, is identified and has the potential to become even more important in the future.

Each group was asked comparable questions about desired course delivery methods, course content, and statistical coverage. Several significant gaps were found between the two groups but none larger than the perception of which statistical methods should be taught in the undergraduate research class. It is clear that both groups could benefit from learning more about each other’s preferences and reasoning."

This article presents an evolved method, reality based learning, that aids professors in including active learning activities with feelings of clarity and confidence. The reality-based learning method subjects each learning activity to a 4-point framework that is used by the professor in all stages, planning, implementation, and review. Its solid rationale, rigorous standards, and logical applicability are intended to ease professors' confusion and apprehension about active and experiential learning. Furthermore, professors will find that they can truly make a difference in their students'transferability of knowledge, skills, and attitudes from the confines of a classroom to their interactions in the broader world. Finally, its applications are demonstrated in an extended diagnostic approach to the selection of an activity for one specific content area."

A review of the literature provides insight for making choices with regards to two aspects of discussion design: (a) the choice between face-to-face and online (i.e., threaded bulletin boards) delivery modes and (b) the choice between structured and unstructured discussion. Exploratory research is explicated that lends support to recommendations made relevant to matching desired learning outcomes and discussion activity design."

The poten- tial impacts of grade point average and education level of students were also investigated. The results from a survey of students in marketing classes from two major universities in the United States reveal that perceived ethical problems and perceived importance of ethics have positive impacts on ethi- cal intentions of students. The survey results reveal a reverse relationship between relativism and ethical intention. There is, however, no relationship between idealism and ethical intentions. As hypothesized, the results indicate that male stu- dents tend to be less ethical in their intention than female stu- dents. The findings indicate that grade point average and educational level are not determinants of ethical intentions of students. Some important implications for marketing education and for the management ethics training programs were discussed."
