Both Donaldson and Watson highlight the important role that theory plays in management education, but limit their discussion to variance theory--one of two fundamental types of theory in social science research. Given that variance theory has long been the dominant paradigm held by scientists and philosophers as well as the general public, it isn't surprising that both professors emphasize this orientation. Variance theory explains the variation in a dependent variable as a result of the variation in an independent variable. More generally, this approach attempts to explain a phenomenon using a small set of well-developed variables, embedded in a nomological net, tested with statistical techniques, and suited to predicting specific outcomes that are unaffected by the temporal ordering of the independent variables. Alternatively, process theory develops a causal explanation of a sequence of events over time by telling a story about how and why a phenomenon evolved as a result of the temporal ordering and probabilistic interaction of numerous events.","Chiles, Todd H",-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Chiles, Todd H",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,4,288,291,

The salaries and rates of return for recent business school graduates suggest that the MBA has not, in fact, outlived its usefulness. An issue casting doubt on the rate of return on the MBA is that the degree represents a signal to potential employers, but may not increase an employee's productivity. Some have argued that the increase in earnings derives not only from human capital investment, but also from pure differences in personal ability. The increased earnings of people with MBA degrees could be partly attributed to innate differences in abilities and not to schooling. The expected rate of return for an MBA, while still high, has recently declined. New graduates with MBA degrees are reporting fewer jobs upon graduation than their predecessors. Given the sluggish economy, a few more bleak years may be in store for MBA holders. On the bright side, the economic slowdown has lowered the opportunity cost of an MBA: Wages and opportunities outside of business school are not as enticing as during a robust economy. Furthermore, interest costs for borrowing to finance the MBA are at historic lows.","Connolly, Michael",-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Connolly, Michael",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,4,365,367,

The student-as-client model fails in comparison to the partnership model in several significant ways. For example, a major problem with the student-as-client model is that it implies that the professor has all the knowledge and expertise, and the only challenge is to get that knowledge and expertise to the student-client in a satisfactory way. On the other hand, the student-as-junior-partner model focuses attention on learning as a partnership--both students and faculty are looking for personal growth and development. In other words, the partnership model puts the focus on joint learning within a junior-senior partner framework, whereas the client model ignores learning and professional growth on the part of the faculty member. Equally important, the partnership model sees education as helping students learn how to learn. In sum, the partnership model implies an ideal that nevertheless stems from the real. The client model ignores the sense of an ideal while falling considerably short in describing the real.

The once accepted Harvard model of capstone integration and learning-by-doing through case discussion is now much less in vogue. Consequently, strategy students today tend to experience a rather abstract approach to learning about strategy presented through the limited prism of a theoretical discipline. Even classroom discussions of cases are often guided by instructors to confirm the utility of a particular theoretical framework, instead of serving as an open-ended discussion of problems and solutions. After presenting our evidence and arguments against the current trend, we present some examples of MBA programs that give more emphasis to practice, including USC's Executive MBA program, where priority is placed on integration and implementation without sacrificing, we believe, essential theories and analytical skills. Finally, we explore the implications from our analysis for additional solutions in other strategy teaching contexts.

However, business students appear to be somewhat skeptical of this claim. One reason for this skepticism may be students' attention to recruiter signals concerning the importance of behavioral knowledge and skills during the recruitment and selection process.  In an attempt to determine whether the addition of significant behavioral coursework to a student's portfolio enhances recruiters' assessments of student employability, we conducted two studies using different methodologies. Results showed that when asked directly about their preferences (Study 1), a clear majority of recruiters (78{\%}) indicated that they preferred business graduates who supplemented functional-area (e.g., finance, accounting) coursework with equivalent amounts of behavioral coursework. However, when evaluating specific student resumes (Study 2), recruiters gave the same employability ratings to students who took only functional courses as to those who focused both on functional and behavioral courses. Our results are discussed in the context of growing evidence that behavioral science is regarded as a marginal topic both in business and in business education.

In recent years, however, its popularity has led to uses beyond its original application for management development. In particular, 360-degree assessment is now replacing the traditional performance appraisal. This trend toward multiple uses--especially administrative ones--should raise concerns, and we discuss its implications. In particular, our focus is on dilemmas created when a feedback tool is stretched to include potentially conflicting aims. We carry out our analysis on three levels (individual, interpersonal, and organizational) using three frames (cognitive, psychometric, and game-theoretical). It leads to the conclusion that if used for multiple purposes 360-degree assessment is in danger of losing its efficacy as a process to deliver honest and constructive feedback. We suggest that it is time for reinvention of the tool and its process methodology. In particular, we argue for the development of two distinct tools--one for management development and one for performance feedback. The management development tool would rely more heavily upon qualitative feedback and competences for development. The performance appraisal feedback tool would be designed around quantitative feedback and measuring performance outcomes.

Research at both the graduate and undergraduate levels suggests that the relationship between student and supervisor is a significant predictor of success and failure in independent research projects. One personality variable shown to be partly responsible for shaping the overall effectiveness of such relationships is cognitive style, defined as consistent individual differences in how we perceive, organize, and process information; solve problems; learn; and relate to others. In this study we examined the effects of differences and similarities in the analytic--intuitive dimension of cognitive style on the supervision process. Data were collected from both partners in 421 dyadic relationships, each comprising an academic supervisor and a management student undertaking a major research project. Findings suggest that analytic supervisors were perceived to be significantly more nurturing and less dominant than their more intuitive counterparts, indicating a higher degree of closeness in their relationships. This led to increased liking in the relationship, and significantly higher performance outcomes for the student. These effects were highest in dyads whose students and supervisors were more analytic.

Peer review is also among the most powerful socializing devices exercised by business schools, and is thus central in educating the professoriate. Bedeian, always the provocateur, follows a simple logic to make a profound point. To begin with, knowledge is socially constructed. Although the relevant literature is admirably reviewed here, this is not a new proposition. But, it takes on special poignancy when peer review is considered because the process is undeniably social in nature. The negotiations among authors, referees, and editors most certainly result in tailored knowledge claims. To be sure, peer review protects broadly accepted standards. But four or fewer arbitrators do not make for a representative sample, and the likelihood of idiosyncratic interests seeping in is enormous. Bedeian claims that the result is all too often the violation of authorial voice, that what authors set out to say is compromised, sometimes beyond recognition. Bedeian concludes with ten rectifying recommendations, such as greater use of footnotes, publishing referee comments, and a meaningful formal appeal procedure, all of which could be reasonably instituted by any journal.","Bailey, James R",-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Bailey, James R",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,#N/A,197,-x-,

The article began by critiquing the customary and conventional approach to international management training. The problem, not uncommon in training venues, is the one-stop shopping philosophy that treats all participants identically, overemphasizes informational components, assumes uniform behavior from cultural actors, and overrelies an analogical reasoning. Then Earley and Peterson is continued by building on work on social and emotional intelligence to advance the concept of CQ. The strength of their examination of CQ is integrating metacognitive-cognitive, motivational, and behavioral dimensions along the lines of Sternberg's triarchic model. CQ is not offered as an innate, static determinant of one's ability to navigate complex cultural situations. Rather, CQ is a basis by which cognitive, metacognitive, motivational and behavioral components of successful intercultural adaptation can be apprehended and, consequently, taught.","Bailey, James R",-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Bailey, James R",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,#N/A,99,-x-,

This money metaphor objectifies education.  The economic metaphor and its effects on the educational process are discussed with the intent of increasing awareness of the implications of the metaphor.  The metaphorical linkages between money and grades are explained.  The social criticisms of money that help explain why the money metaphor is problematic for the education domain are reviewed.  The main criticisms offered address the intrinsic nonmaterial goals of education and the student-teacher relationship, both of which are poorly represented by the grades-as-money metaphor.

What has received relatively less attention is the influence of the social component that shapes the content of the discipline's published record and, in turn, determines its scientific progress. As the product of social processes, all knowledge-claims are socially constituted rather than the products of an absolute truth. Taking a sociology-of-knowledge perspective, I argue that the social processes underlying the peer-review process warrant closer scrutiny. In doing so, I contend that there must be a balancing of the inevitable author-editor-referee tensions operating throughout the editorial process so as to ensure that a clear authorial voice is preserved. I offer suggestions for assuring the integrity of the scientific enterprise, while respecting the prerogatives and ethics of authorship.

There are many reasons why those training for careers as management scholars should be acquainted with the history of the discipline of management.  Among the lessons to be learned from the historical study of management thinking is that ideas are always a product of their own time and place.  Another profitable lesson that doctoral students will gain from studying the history of management thought is the advantage of being an informed consumer of received knowledge.  Another lesson doctoral students will learn from the studying history of management is the danger inherent in relying on secondary source materials.  Historical illiteracy may explain another lesson of historical scholarship.  Widely accepted facts are often wrong.  Also, doctoral students studying the history of management will learn a lesson dubbed as a special advantage of the past, that is, it allows association with superior minds.

We describe a university course intended to develop students' teamwork KSAs. Results from a quasi-experimental evaluation study demonstrate that the course significantly increased the levels of students' teamwork knowledge and skills. However, the course did not significantly improve teamwork-related attitudes and self-efficacy. We discuss implications for school-to-work policies and the development of teamwork KSAs in higher education settings, as well as directions for future research.

Specifically, we hypothesized that the relationship between learning motivation and learning outcomes would be moderated by individuals' psychological hardiness. We collected data in two studies. The first established the psychometric properties of a newly developed scale, the second tested related research hypotheses. After controlling for socially desirable responding and dispositional learning orientations, our hypothesized interaction between participants' initial motivation to learn and their psychological hardiness explained differences in participants' postlearning motivation, depressive symptomatology, and reactions to their classroom experience assessed 2 months later. The study's findings have particular relevance for anyone who has ever taught or been involved in teaching. At times, for example, students can feel overwhelmed by the numerous responsibilities associated with being a college student. As a result, some will suffer a loss in motivation to perform and, even worse, a few will experience a severe state of depressed mood. Consequently, in this study we address these concerns and offer specific recommendations that could be implemented by universities and instructors to circumvent these detrimental outcomes.

Many master of business administration degree admission procedures are based on a collection of criteria adopted and perpetuated without serious consideration of the predictive validity of each requirement.  Every group with a stake in educating and hiring MBAs, as well as potential MBA students, should strive to understand program selection systems and work to put in place criteria that accurately reflect desired outcomes.  MBA admission systems should be of the same high quality as the best systems used by the organizations hiring their graduates.  Organizations should systematically evaluate the quality of the admission procedures associated with the schools from which they recruit MBA-level talent.  MBA admission directors should be able to clearly describe the knowledge, skills and abilities their admission processes target.  For each identified competency, there should be a clear and well thought out approach to measurement.  Employers will likely find that a high-quality admission program has been built on a sound footing of program evaluation.  A sign that the MBA admission program is of high quality is that it is sensitive to the MBA-program curriculum.  MBA programs will be improved when investigators learn more about the connections between such admission policies, educational processes and career success.","Dreher, George F; Ryan, Katherine C",17,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Dreher, George F","Ryan, Katherine C",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,3,87,91,

Where historically the focus of intercultural training has been on preparing an individual to work in a new culture, today's organizations routinely ask managers to work in multinational environments and move from country to country. This challenge has created a strong debate about how to prepare managers for such challenging assignments. How ought people be assessed to understand their readiness for such assignments? Do high intelligence quotient (IQ) people adjust better than others to new cultural challenges? The topic of cultural adjustment and its assessment remains compelling but incomplete. Our focus here is the development and exploration of the concept of cultural intelligence, or, CQ (Earley, 2003; Earley {\&} Ang, 2003), along with its implications for training and education for global work assignments. Our approach suggests that training for the global manager should include metacognitive, motivational, and behavioral components.

The solution proposed is a body of thought called critical management education (CME).  CME is that body of educational practice arising from a research tradition known as critical management studies (CMS).  One barrier to the consideration of CME is that CME has mostly arisen and been most widely discussed and practiced not in the United States but in Europe, possibly because that is where a large number of new business schools have been founded in recent decades. Yet it is in the U.S. that the bulk of business schools, and the bulk of prestigious schools as well, are to be found.  CME does require that one accepts the core claim of CMS of the unavoidable presence of values. It does not require that we all agree with CMS on what those values are.  In view of implications for management education, they suggest that management needs always be taught in ways that explicitly acknowledge the political, ethical, and philosophical nature of its practice.","Grey, Christopher",-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Grey, Christopher",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,4,178,186,

We use the literatures on management education, technology acceptance, and change implementation to develop and test a model predicting business school students' acceptance of a Web-based course management system. Arguing that such a system which transitions traditional course-management processes to the Web constitutes an instance of a process change, we examine the role played by various change-enabling factors as well as change-motivating factors in students' acceptance of the system. We find that perceived incentive to use the system, perceived faculty encouragement to use the system, and peer encouragement to use the system are positively related to perceived usefulness of the system, which in turn is positively related to student acceptance of the system. We also find that awareness of the capabilities of the system, perceived availability of technical support, and prior experience with computer and Web use are positively related to perceived ease of use of the system, which in turn is positively related to student acceptance of the system. Implications for management education research and practice are discussed.

The AC included a combination of in-basket, leaderless group discussion, case, interview simulation, and oral presentation exercises, as well as paper-and-pencil measures including Big Five personality variables. Assessment was performed using three trained assessors for each assessee. These assessees also participated in a follow-up survey, typically between 2 and 3 1/2 years following AC participation. We designed the survey to measure early career progress in the form of job satisfaction, number of promotions, and current salary. Analyses revealed that student grade point average (GPA) was generally not a good predictor of early career progress, with the exception of salary. In contrast, AC performance was most consistently predictive of both intrinsic and extrinsic aspects of career success, even after controlling for personality and GPA. Results are discussed in terms of their relevance to academically based assessment centers and the career success literature.

The decisions of team leaders in fire zones are unusually clear-cut and consequential for the goals of the enterprise, but they are not unlike decisions faced by managers of most organizations. We suggest that three factors--underpreparation, acute stress, and ambiguous authority--can result in suboptimal decisions by team leaders on a fireline. Through detailed evaluation of the team leader's ten most consequential decisions in the South Canyon fire, we conclude that five were relatively optimal for the triple objectives of safety, speed, and suppression, but five others proved suboptimal. Much of their suboptimality is traced to the fact that the team leader was undertrained for leadership decision making, faced intense stress, and operated without clear authority. In the wake of this firefighting disaster--14 men and women lost their lives-- the fire service created a development program using both classroom and experiential methods for preparing its leaders to make good and timely decisions. The South Canyon fire and its aftermath point to the value of explicit preparation in leadership decisions by both fire services and business schools as part of their efforts to enhance strategic thinking and other essential leadership attributes for achieving organizational goals in high stress environments.

Our aim is to help educators understand their intuition and ultimately enhance their instructional effectiveness by making better classroom decisions on the basis of intuitive judgments. We outline the limits of technical-rationalist approaches and then call upon relevant constructs and processes from the intuitive domain, including tacit knowledge and implicit learning, in order to formulate a working definition of instructor intuition. We also present various types of instructional situations that are suited for intuition, along with the benefits for teaching and learning and the potential limitations. Suggestions are offered such that instructors may learn to capitalize on the advantages of using their intuition, yet minimize the disadvantages, and also on how they may educate the intuitive awareness of their students. In this way, the accumulation of learned knowledge and distilled experience within an educational setting can be more effectively leveraged to enhance the performance of individual students, the instructors themselves, and the educational institutions of which they are a part.

Numerous reasons for this effect have been suggested and vigorously debated. In this study, we propose a new hypothesis for the relationship, called reciprocity, which states that students reward instructors who give them good grades and punish instructors who give them poor grades, irrespective of any instructor or preexisting student characteristic. Using within-class data we found that changes in grades in the last half of a term were met with systematic and corresponding changes in the evaluations students gave to their instructors. Further, we found a relationship between change in grades and change in evaluations when controlling for both student and instructor characteristics.

A transformational program presupposes a change in behavior of the attending executive so that the latter becomes more effective in personal or organizational change. To understand what influences the transformational process three triangular conceptual frameworks (building on the short-term dynamic psychotherapy tradition) are presented: the mental life triangle, the conflict triangle, and the relationships triangle. The first shows that cognitive and emotional processes need to be taken into consideration to create changes in behavior. The second describes the sources of thoughts and feelings that may prompt anxiety and cause defensive reactions prohibiting change and productive use of talents. The third relationships triangle explains how an individual's previous experiences create patterns of response that are repeated throughout life and can become dysfunctional. Five major challenges in program design are also examined: selecting participants; identifying the focal issue on which participants need to work; the creation of a safe transitional space that enables the change process; using the group dynamic to foster transformation and to arrive at internalization of the change process; and the educational implications for faculty, facilitators, and coaches.

Other providers view EE as a core competency that is their primary raison d'etre.

The sustained pressure in business schools to adopt a teaching curriculum and pedagogical approach that appears immediately relevant to the perceived needs of practitioners is overwhelming. Yet, universities are distinct from consultancies or other professional management institutes in that traditionally they provide well-established forums for intellectual exchange and encourage crossfertilization among academic disciplines. We maintain that university-based business schools are uniquely positioned to use their internal university-wide expertise and core capabilities to inculcate paradigmatic awareness among business executives to enable them to enlarge their horizons of understanding and hence extend their decisional possibilities. For us, this is the true competitive advantage of university-based business schools over corporate universities, management training institutes, and consultancies. We maintain that university-based business schools can paradoxically be invaluable to business and industry, not by becoming overly anxious about immediate relevance, but by recognizing that the education and development of the individual as a whole through exposure to a plurality of paradigms and perspectives, is what sets universities apart and makes them distinct from other executive education providers. Their real value to the practitioner world is in offering truly fresh insights and genuine radical alternatives to executive problem situations through novel interpretations that are counterintuitive to received wisdom and best practice.

It hit me one day--for no obvious reason--that I have never been fond of large organizations (though some--by no means all--small organizations are quite lovable). Like many colleagues, I have researched big American and overseas organizations, consulted with them, tried to help humanize them, conducted courses and seminars for their people, taught here and abroad in business schools that prepared students to participate in them, and focused my professional life around them. Despite liking--indeed often bonding with--many of the people of big organizations, I now realize that I have long felt rather distanced from the institutions themselves, implicitly viewing them as unhealthy places for us humans, as flawed, erosive, imprisoning. I should add that--though now conscious of that standoffish posture--I do not plan to abandon it. While this is written from an American perspective, I believe that big organizations everywhere, today as well as yesterday, are psychologically unhealthy environments. I also suspect that my semiconscious negativity is shared by many others in the community of organizational social scientists, consultants, and executives, and that it has influenced my and our teaching and research in ways of which I haven't been fully aware. Acknowledging that reality from the get-go may even help us to make those organizations more livable as well as more effective.

I cover both the needed knowledge content (e.g., teaching, research, and service skills) and the career stages that need to be successfully navigated (e.g., getting a job, surviving as an assistant professor, getting tenure and other professional roles such as being a journal editor, consultant, or department chair).

Technological and social changes in the wider environment can have major implications for teaching and learning pedagogies-i.e., optimal teaching and learning occur when teaching styles align with learning styles. For that reason, we consider some key learning principles in light of the learning styles of our current generation of students, who are quite facile with virtual technologies. We argue that the effective use of some electronic learning tools can provide useful and engaging means for their education by addressing this generation's preferences for virtual media while also enabling student-directed interactivity (via online searches, games, simulations, etc.). We first articulate the conceptual grounds for arguing that there has been another shift in the teaching and learning environment we now face-which implies some necessary adaptation of traditional learning principles. We then discuss: (a) some technologies and applications (mainly Internet-based tools and videogames) that can facilitate the convergence between virtual generation (V-Gen) preferences and classroom interactions; (b) some guidelines for using these technologies to fulfil these learning principles and; (c) some pitfalls that can occur and how to avoid them","Proserpio, Luigi; Gioia, Dennis A",17,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Proserpio, Luigi","Gioia, Dennis A",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,3,69,80,

Millions of dollars are spent each year on development initiatives that often fail to transfer into performance gains, primarily due to insufficient support given to the learning transfer process. One initiative used by companies to develop managerial skills is the 360 feedback process. This process has been recognized by some for its value because of its inherent ability to reinforce learning and create actionable knowledge. Some companies have gone so far as to assume that the 360 feedback process will apply equally across cultures. Given that different cultures hold different values, the assumption needs to be examined. The question of cultural relevance for the 360 feedback process was examined across five countries in this study. The results provide support for the overall effectiveness of the 360 process across the combined sample. Comparisons among the five countries, however, revealed important differences. The results were examined based on Hofstede's four work-related values. The 360 feedback process was found to be most effective in cultures with low power distance and individualistic values. The implications for both practice and research are discussed.

There has been, however, a concern that business schools are increasingly uncoupled from practice and that business school research lacks real-world relevance. This relevance-rigor gap affects the quality of our teaching as well as the institutional legitimacy of our business schools. We argue that executive education is an underutilized context that can enhance the quality of faculty research as well as our impact on managerial practice. Using evaluation data from variations of a single executive education program, we find that action-learning programs significantly enhance both individual and organizational outcomes compared to traditional executive education formats. Action-learning programs also enhance our teaching and research efforts. Building on these results and experiences, we suggest that executive education in general, and action learning in particular, are fertile contexts where business schools can bridge the relevance-rigor gap.

We contribute here to an integration of past research and propose and test a multifaceted construct of thinking style based on two primary dimensions: linear thinking (e.g., rationality, logic, analytic thinking) and nonlinear thinking (e.g., intuition, insight, creativity). We present and validate in four separate studies a self-report diagnostic instrument (Linear-Nonlinear Thinking Style Profile or LNTSP) for measuring an individual's linear and nonlinear thinking style profile. Validation study results across student, professional, and managerial samples reveal a 4-factor model of linear and nonlinear thinking style involving the manner in which individuals attend to a particular kind of information source (internal vs. external) and subsequent linear versus nonlinear processing of that information. The results also indicate that the LNTSP has acceptable convergent validity vis-{\`{a}}-vis two commonly used and conceptually related instruments, the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) and Cognitive Style Index, as well as external validity and face validity across students from different academic major programs (e.g., liberal arts vs. business and engineering), individuals from distinctly different professional careers (i.e., professional actors and accountants), and managerial and professional workshop participants. We discuss implications of these results for future research, as well as possible beneficial use of the LNTSP for management education and business practice.

Based on a sample of 525 members of the Academy of Management, we conclude that there is an increasing emphasis toward teaching management theory compared to earlier data collection. In the 1970s, the theory-application balance was tipped in favor of theory. However, in the 1980s there was a significant swing away from theory toward application. Now, we appear to be back to the trends of the 1970s, with an emphasis of theory over practical application. We discuss the implications of these findings in light of recent concerns over the role of theory in management classrooms.

Learning styles also had a significant relationship. Subjects who spent most of their time performing management functions and whose dominant learning styles were accommodating had significantly higher LAMTK than those with different learning styles.

In reaction to early criticism of being trade schools, business schools have emphasized the academic nature of business education. The pendulum has now moved in the direction toward greater inclusion of real-world experience. As a result, many business schools are hiring business practitioners to teach courses. We examine the current state of business education and the tension that exists in many business schools today concentrating on the use of executive professors in the business school. Recommendations are provided regarding the use of executive professors.

The second details seven key differences in managing services that are either minimally covered or ignored in traditional management courses. The third offers some suggestions as to how management scholars and educators can add coverage of these unique challenges and opportunities of managing services to our curriculum.

Trainer race and sex had no impact on trainee evaluations when the course was focused on similarities, whereas trainees in the course highlighting differences responded least favorably to the White male trainer.

Overall, there was considerable variance in the content of organizational missions. Using a previously established framework to analyze mission content, we found business school missions generally lacked comprehensiveness.

While the as-is' process highlights and potentially remedies some of the abuses of the system, there may be less radical options through professional education and development to preserve the critical developmental function of peer review.

Another goal is to facilitate an open discussion about how AACSB accreditation impacts business schools and perhaps motivate faculty to reconsider their perceptions about it.

We examine factors that influence ethnic minorities' (Black/African-American and Latinos) decisions to pursue PhDs in business by surveying a sample of participants at the annual PhD Project prospective business doctoral student conference.

I also show that two longer term trends--the growth of for-profit universities and the globalization of business education coupled with the diffusion of accreditation--are likely to have an impact on business school enrollment markets both within and outside the United States. My conclusion is that accreditation can be beneficial to many business schools for two reasons. One reason is that accreditation processes require that business schools gain clarity about the markets they serve and the services they offer, which is increasingly important as enrollment markets grow more competitive. The other reason is that the value of accreditation as a quality differentiator appears to be rising in the markets for part-time working students and international students.

Given the popularity of student teams as a teaching and learning tool in undergraduate business classrooms, as well as the near absence of research that has focused on students' definition of the problem, our purpose was to develop preliminary findings and spur new thinking about social loafing in this context. A definition of the construct was developed, and its key antecedents and consequences identified by way of exploratory analysis of student perceptions. The resulting hypotheses and conceptual model were tested using a structural equations model by way of a survey of 349 students taking classes in an undergraduate business program. Student perceptions of social loafing seem more complex than current views suggest. They point to student apathy and social disconnectedness as antecedents, and note that they take compensatory action when members of their teams social loaf.

As a result, we posit that business schools are increasingly invested with the function of identity workspaces.

This case example of a business elective about sustainable community development in a third world country serves to illustrate the framework for delivering such content. The unique characteristics of sustainable community development are integrated with the strengths of service learning into a framework that may be used by others who might develop similar courses.

In addition, instructor, course, and institution-level characteristics were examined as potential correlates of references to EBM. Using a liberal operationalization of EBM (i.e., keywords or phrases that are consistent with evidence-based management principles), results suggest that approximately 25{\%} of core MBA management courses utilize EBM in some form. However, there are substantial differences across categories of course content and depending on whether the instructor has a PhD. Evidence-based management-consistent syllabi are most prevalent at the MBA level in organizational behavior and least in international management and entrepreneurship. Suggestions for future research, as well as an exemplary course description from an EBM syllabus, are offered.

The result is a grading paradox. We hypothesize that leveraging choice in the classroom can manage this grading paradox by increasing interest. In a field experiment in real-world MBA classrooms (N = 91 students), we found that a choice intervention, the opportunity for students to allocate the weight of several course components toward their final course grade, was associated with higher levels of two types of interest, triggered situational interest and maintained situational interest. This study corroborates and extends previous laboratory-based research documenting the positive relationship between choice and interest, and offers a practical tool that management educators can use to encourage student interest.

Business schools have come under increasing attack for their espousal of a strong form neoliberal belief system rooted in the discipline of economics and a lack of attention to practical and, in particular, heterogeneous national institutional contexts. A key insight emerging from a growing chorus of retrospective analyses of the crisis is the need for research and pedagogy to draw upon the breadth of social sciences to inform decision making under uncertainty and more prominently features cross-national variation in institutional context as well as systemic linkages between the behavior of individuals, organizations, academics, regulators and policy makers. While business schools are theoretically ideally positioned to offer such innovation and have done so in the past, the institutional barriers to change are substantial. Drawing on paired historical narratives of institutional changes to business schools and economic policy making, I outline a political strategy that leverages neoliberalism's legitimacy crisis to forge alliances with government and civil society actors who share an interest in fulfilling the promise of progressive management.

The results, based on a sample of 167 college student interns working in the retail industry, indicate that emotional sharing is positively related to both learning and mentoring, while emotional masking is negatively related to learning. In addition, intern social activity is positively related to mentoring.

We describe ""Project Ulysses,"" an integrated service-learning program which involves sending participants in teams to developing countries to work in cross-sector partnerships with NGOs, social entrepreneurs, or international organizations. In order to understand how Ulysses participants learn from their experiences while abroad, we interviewed 70 participants and content-analyzed the learning narratives that they produced. We found evidence of learning in six areas: responsible mind-set, ethical literacy, cultural intelligence, global mind-set, self-development, and community building. We also identified a number of processes through which learning occurred at the cognitive, affective, and behavioral levels, including the process of resolving cultural and ethical paradoxes; constructing a new life-world, that is, developing a new perspective of self and the world; and making sense of the emotions experienced while on assignment. The results of a postprogram survey confirm the long-term effectiveness of Ulysses in developing and enhancing competencies that are critical for responsible global leadership. We discuss the implications for theory building on responsible leadership and helping organizations leverage the potential of international service-learning programs for developing responsible global leaders.","PLESS, NICOLA M; MAAK, THOMAS; STAHL, G{\{U}}NTER K""",16,30,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"PLESS, NICOLA M","MAAK, THOMAS","STAHL, G{\{U}}NTER K""",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,4,237,260,

Despite this fact, recent research suggests that courses designed to inculcate human capital competencies are wholly underrepresented in MBA curricula. Scholars have attributed culpability in various directions, collectively suggesting a broad devaluing of management education from one or more stakeholders including recruiters, business school policy makers, faculty members, and students. We bring forth evidence that reveals considerable agreement across stakeholder groups regarding the importance of emphasizing human capital competencies in MBA curricula. That is, contrary to conventional notions, business school stakeholders largely agree with practicing managers that human capital competencies are among the most important to be trained within MBA programs. This evidence suggests an Abilene paradox (Harvey, 1974) wherein the status quo of curricular misalignment is maintained due to a mismanagement of agreement. As such, we argue management faculty must deploy an evidence-based campaign that productively surfaces this agreement and moves MBA programs toward enacting appropriate curricular change congruent with managerial realities.

To address this challenge, we draw on the work of Pierre Bourdieu to examine MBA education as an activity with its own ""economy of exchange"" and ""rules of the game."" We argue that application of Bourdieu's theoretical ideas elucidates three key issues in debate around MBA education: the outcomes of MBA programs, the inculcation of potentially problematic values and practices through the programs, and the potential of self-regulation, such as accreditation and ranking for impeding development of MBA education. First, Bourdieu's notions of capitalintellectual, social, and symbolicshed light on the ""economy of exchange"" in MBA education. Critics of MBA programs have pointed out that the value of MBA degrees lies not only in ""learning."" Bourdieu's framework allows further analysis of this issue by distinguishing between intellectual (learning), social (social networks), and symbolic capital (credentials and prestige). Second, the concept of ""habitus"" suggests how values and practices are inculcated through MBA education. This process is often one students acquire voluntarily, and students often regard problematic or ethically questionable ideas as natural. Third, Bourdieu's reflections on the ""doxa"" and its reproduction and legitimation illuminate the role of accreditation and ranking in MBA education. This perspective helps to understand how self-regulation may impede change in MBA education.","VAARA, EERO; FA, ERIC",12,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"VAARA, EERO","FA, ERIC",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,3,27,39,

We also find systematic differences in how boards allocate their attention, based on whether the business school has a research or teaching orientation. We further find that boards' effort and attention affect directors' preferences of the content and approach of entrepreneurship programs, gauging student learning, obstacles to board contributions, and the relative emphasis on the skills students are taught.

Explicit presentations of both the honor code reminder and the realistic course warning led to significant reductions in academic cheating. In addition, we predicted and found a 3-way interaction indicating that students with the highest self-perceived cognitive ability engaged in the least cheating, especially when both the honor code reminder and the realistic course warning were presented at the outset of the semester. Conversely, when neither the honor code reminder nor the realistic course warning was presented, students low in self-perceived cognitive ability cheated the most. These results suggest that an academic institute's possession of an honor code reminder alone is not sufficient to substantially reduce academic cheating, and that an explicit reminder of the honor code and a realistic course warning together will produce the greatest reduction in cheating. Implications for reducing academic cheating using proactive interventions in the classroom are provided, and future research directions are discussed.

We implemented a team decision-making task with 52 student teams, objectively measured team performance, and then asked team members and teams for assessments of team performance. Results show that relationship conflict moderates the relationship between (a) team objective performance and individual assessments of team performance (i.e., cross-level interaction effect); and (b) team objective performance and team assessments of team performance (i.e., team-level interaction effect). The moderating effect is isomorphic across levels of analysis: As relationship conflict increases, the relationship between subjective and objective performance also increases. Our results have important implications for research on management education, assessments of team performance, relationship conflict, and methodological approaches adopted by management education researchers.

However, much is left to be learned about how on-line tools influence student learning. In this manuscript, we use the community of inquiry (COI) framework to examine the contribution of one on-line tool, a wiki, to a blended-learning course. Structural modeling techniques are used to analyze data collected from students in an undergraduate business capstone course. The results suggest that teaching presence, social presence, and cognitive presence (components of the community of inquiry framework) exist in a wiki environment in a manner similar to other on-line environments. Additionally, teaching presence and social presence are shown to influence cognitive presence (e.g., learning), which reaffirms that the role of the instructor continues to be paramount to student learning in technology-enhanced environments. Given that the COI framework is a novel conceptualization recently introduced to the management education literature, we offer theoretical recommendations for researchers and practical recommendations for instructors interested in incorporating wiki technology in a blended-learning pedagogy. We believe our findings provide fresh insights on, and new possibilities for, instructional development in business education.

He suggests that social entrepreneurship is an important transitional vehicle toward the creation of shared value and a capitalist system in which meeting social needs is not just a peripheral activity but a core aspect of every business. Porter discusses the implications of this perspective on social entrepreneurship with a view to new opportunities but also responsibilities for educators in the field. I examine how this fits with but also extends current debates on social entrepreneurship. The interview concludes by examining where Porter's ideas may take us and reflecting on social entrepreneurship education as conversations about the social becoming more entrepreneurial but also the entrepreneurial becoming more social.

This article draws from literatures in geography and anthropology to offer a place-based perspective that we believe enriches our understanding of social context and provides new approaches to teaching the subject. We begin by considering the limitations of existing approaches to understanding social context and then present a four-frame model of place-based thinking (Gruenewald, 2003) with implications for teaching social entrepreneurship and innovation. Afterward we present a case study of a project-oriented, place-based learning approach to social entrepreneurship and innovation around water, sanitation, and hygiene (WaSH) in the informal settlements of Cape Town, South Africa. We discuss how the use of place enriches our students' understanding of the WaSH-related innovations there. We also reflect on the successes, failures and place-based experiments. Implications for a new approach to teaching social entrepreneurship and innovation are also discussed.

We compare measures of task performance when participants observe a task before engaging in direct experience versus immediate direct experience without observation. Two experimental studies were conducted using different types of tasks and different levels of performance analysis. We found support for the hypothesis that experiential learning sequencing, with vicarious observation preceding direct experiential learning, enhances classroom performance. The benefits of vicarious observational learning to direct experience sequencing appeared to be generally robust across task types and levels of analysis. The article concludes with some explanations of the relative efficacy of observational learning to direct experiential learning sequencing as well as implications for management education literature and practice.

The results of the analyses of this relationship are controversial in that at least some members of some groups continue to hold different views. In their work, Pearce and Huang support the perspective that management research should inform managerial practice. However, they argue that the amount of 'actionable research' (research that teachers can effectively use in their classrooms) that is being published in two prestigious journals ( Academy of Management Journal and Administrative Science Quarterly ) is declining. Pearce and Huang speculate as to why this is the case and propose solutions to deal with the issue. Herein, I speak to the context and framing of the Pearce and Huang study, offering an alternative definition of actionable research in the process of doing so. Using Pearce and Huang's results and the perspectives included here, I close with a set of recommendations about future work that might be completed as a foundation for continuing the dialogue about the relationship between management research and managerial practice.

We use the research on team effectiveness and organizational justice to develop hypotheses regarding two categories of design decisions: grading and use of class time. We collected data from instructors at a United States college on how they designed team projects and from students in these courses regarding perceived fairness and evaluation of their instructor. Results indicate that design decisions influence U.S. students' evaluations of instructors, consistent with the individualistic U.S. culture and with perceptions of fairness. Our findings should be of interest both to U.S. academicians, given the extreme weight evaluations are given in the promotion and tenure process, and academicians from other cultures as a cultural insight about U.S. students. Our results also point to the potential tension instructors face when challenging students to develop the necessary skills to function effectively in a global society.

We formulate a model of identity-based disengagement in an attempt to understand why some students choose to reject learning opportunities. Management education in particular may be subject to student disengagement due to learning activities that engender affective, identity-challenging responses. Using social identity theory, we model how some learning activities can trigger elements of students' identities, forcing a cognitive dissonance confrontation. We suggest that students undertake an identity-based risk-reward assessment when determining which learning opportunities to accept or reject. We argue that by increasing sensitivity to the process of disengagement, instructors can help draw students back into learning opportunities.

In this paper, I quantify the cost of production of not-actionable articles, explain why I think that their production has flourished, discuss the difficulty of individual scholars speaking to both business and academic audiences, and provide a thought on how to stimulate production of actionable business research output. I estimate that the cost of producing not-actionable 'A-journal' articles is on the order of US{\$}600 million per year. It is not surprising to me that not-actionable article production has increased in that the 'customers' for these articles are primarily other academics and not business people. I demonstrate that for this reason, it proves very difficult for a given scholar to simultaneously speak authoritatively to both fellow academics and business people. Finally, I suggest that to stimulate production of actionable business research output, the Academy needs to harness the power of case-based research methods to identify important actionable business issues and the meticulousness of scientific methodologies to generate rigorous actionable prescriptions for business people.

The suggested model encompasses academics' economic and social values as internal variables, as well as perceived support for attempting to influence values and academic tenure as social and structural variables. A test with empirical data from 1,254 management academics worldwide reveals that perceived external support is most relevant for explaining intentions. Moreover, academics' social values, but not their economic ones, contribute to an explanation of their intentions to influence values. The results reveal how important it is for academics to believe that their colleagues, higher education institutions, and other stakeholders support their value-related behavioral intentions.

We assess internal as well as external factors that may influence whether AACSB-accredited business schools choose to require a business ethics course in their undergraduate core curricula. Using data from 382 universities, we find evidence of a relationship between the characteristics of a business school's leadership and the college's decision to require an ethics course. Specifically, colleges of business whose deans are female or have a background in management are more likely to require their undergraduates to take a business ethics course. In addition, we find that a school's affiliation has a direct influence on this decision. Private schools, as well as universities with religious affiliations, are more likely to require a business ethics course. Also of interest, we find a negative relationship between the resources schools possess and the presence of a required ethics course. These findings suggest that the values of a school and its leadership are the main factors influencing the role of business ethics in a school's curriculum.

Our sample included 31 of the 32 journal editors from the mid-1950s to the mid-2000s of Academy of Management Journal, Academy of Management Review, Administrative Science Quarterly, Journal of Applied Psychology, Journal of Management, and Personnel Psychology who have not retired or passed away studied by Aguinis, de Bruin, Cunningham, Hall, Culpepper, and Gottfredson (2010).

Formulaic research involves extreme specialization, an incrementalist and ultra-cautious attitude toward theoretical contributions, formulaic methodologies, and a standardized article presentation targeted at very narrow and sympathetic academic communities. Formulaic research is attributed to the isomorphism that characterizes a wide range of academic practices. In the hope of galvanizing the field into transformation, we make a number of suggestions for alternative ideals and standards aimed at encouraging more diverse and imaginative ways of practicing and communicating organizational research. This is referred to as polymorphic research. We offer a number of concrete proposals to guide the practices of authors, reviewers, and editors. Polymorphic research, we argue, would reinvigorate the field of organizational studies and enhance its social relevance and impact.

Additionally, we show how incentives to cheat can be altered to make cheating a more or less rationally attractive choice depending on factors such as the psychological safety felt by team members, individual expectations that other team members will cheat, possible fear of group exclusion, the relationship between leader dominance and group member agreeableness. and students' expectations that harsh penalties will be applied.

However, we empirically examine the Financial Times Global MBA Rankings and find that significant shifts have occurred at the international level: U.S. schools have declined, to the advantage of European and Asian schools. This shift corresponds to an erosion of the difference in MBA's salaries between these regions. We examine macro factors that may have played a role in this process: aggregate economic demand, overall supply of MBA graduates, student migrations, and shifts in visa policies. We observe that, over time, European MBAs have experienced a sustained rise in graduate salaries despite low aggregate economic demand and a rising supply of graduates.

Effects of Cross- Cultural Management Courses on Cultural Intelligence.,2103,12,4,,,,,"The rapid increase in courses dealing with cross-cultural management (CCM), brought about by economies' globalization and increased workforce mobility motivated us to examine the impact of cross-cultural management courses on cultural intelligence. Cultural intelligence (CQ) refers to individual's abilities and skills to effectively manage interactions in cross-cultural situations. It includes four dimensions: metacognitive, cognitive, motivational and behavioral. In two multinational longitudinal studies using matched samples and pre- postintervention measures, we assessed the effects of academic CCM courses on students' CQ. We found that after the courses, students' overall CQ was significantly higher than at Time 1. No effects on CQ were detected in the control group, where students worked in multicultural settings but did not take a CCM course. Cross-cultural management courses had stronger effects on metacognitive and cognitive CQ than on motivational and behavioral CQ. We found an interesting pattern regarding students' international experience: While international experience in Time 1 positively related to students' CQ, at Time 2, this relationship became nonsignificant (Study 1). These findings contribute to understanding the antecedents of cultural intelligence and how educational interventions affect it, with practical implications for designing and developing international management education and training programs.

All projects were designed in the same way, according to principles of collaborative experiential learning, and offered a psychologically safe learning environment that enabled trust building. Data on cultural intelligence, global identity, and local identity were collected by way of web-based questionnaires at the beginning and at the end of the project, as well as 6 months later. Team trust was assessed in the middle of the project. Hierarchical linear modeling analyses revealed that cultural intelligence and global identity, but not local identity, significantly increased over time and that this effect lasted for 6 months after the project had ended. Trust as a team level factor moderated the project's effect on team members' cultural intelligence and global identity, with significant effects under moderate to high rather than low levels of trust.

We identify cognitive absorption as the construct that better describes the state of full engagement and immersion that new approaches in management training require of learners. While some research has emphasized the positive effect of absorption. we focus on the drawbacks of this individual state and on how group-level behaviors can mitigate negative effects on individual learning. We test our cross-level model on 190 individuals embedded in 38 groups. Our results show that (1) cognitive absorption presents an inverted U-shape effect in predicting participant learning; and (2) group learning behavior has a cross-level moderating influence on the relationship between cognitive absorption and participant learning, thus mitigating the negative effects of absorption.

Recent research with executives has found that higher cultural metacognition is associated with affective closeness and creative collaboration in intercultural relationships (Chua, Morris, & Mor, & 2012). However, little is known about the social cognitive mechanisms that facilitate the performance of individuals who score high on cultural metacognition. We propose that one important question for cross-cultural research and training is identifying which metacognitive strategies enable successful intercultural collaborations. We suggest that one such strategy is ""cultural perspective taking""--considering how another's cultural background shapes their behavior in a given context. We hypothesized that cultural perspective taking facilitates intercultural coordination and cooperation, and that a manipulation that boosts cultural perspective taking would be especially beneficial for individuals who score low in dispositional cultural metacognition. We found support for the above hypotheses in five studies using both quasi-field and experimental approaches. We discuss the implications of these findings for literatures on expatriate managers, cross-cultural training, cultural intelligence, and intercultural negotiations.","MOR, SHIRA; MORRIS, MICHAEL; JOH, JOHANN",11,28,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"MOR, SHIRA","MORRIS, MICHAEL","JOH, JOHANN",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,4,453,475,

While we applaud this movement from the domestic to the global and from the classroom to the field in business education, we raise a fundamental question that is seldom asked when global service-learning projects are chosen: ""Are some cultural contexts better suited for effective cultural learning and the creation of a global mind-set?"" To respond to this question, we present an exploratory study of culturally inexperienced non-U.S. business students at a U.S. university engaging in a service-learning project for U.S. military veterans. In this project, the veterans with disabilities were choosing entrepreneurship and self-employment as a way to rebuild their lives. From the qualitative data collected, we observed increases in the cultural intelligence of non-U.S. students, particularly in their development of metacognitive/cognitive strategies and the enhancement of their affective/motivational resources for learning across cultures. We examined characteristics of the cultural setting of U.S. military veterans with disabilities, and proposed that four characteristics facilitated the crosscultural learning achieved by the non-U.S. students. These include a moderate level of cultural distance, a tight culture, low context, and high moral desirability. While we hesitate to generalize beyond this cultural context and beyond culturally inexperienced students, we argue for further discussion about, consideration of, and research on the idea that cultural contexts may differ in their ability to stimulate cultural learning and global mind-set development","MOSAKOWSKI, ELAINE; CALIC, GORAN; CHRISTOPHER EARLEY, P",19,33,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"MOSAKOWSKI, ELAINE","CALIC, GORAN","CHRISTOPHER EARLEY, P",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,4,512,526,

We tell of an international education model defined by the prioritization of profit and the belief that students are consumers whose entitlements are determined by the marketplace. The crisis this perspective induced led to the emergence of a more mature governance regime, but problematic aspects of the original model remain. We argue that to achieve stability, a governance network needs to be created, a network that is comprised of a range of stakeholders who have the capacity to countervail each other's power and by so doing curtail practices that place international students and academic values at risk. We suggest the Australian case is an important exemplar of the difficulties that can be generated if the commercialization of international education is inadequately governed and that this exemplar should be accorded due heed by students, faculty, university managers and regulators.","NYLAND, CHRIS; FORBES-MEWETT, HELEN; H{\{A}}RTEL, C",14,36,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"NYLAND, CHRIS","FORBES-MEWETT, HELEN","H{\{A}}RTEL, C",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,4,656,673,

Using random coefficient growth modeling (Bliese {\&} Ployhart, 2002; Ployhart, Holtz, {\&} Bliese, 2002), two manifestations of leadership efficacy were examined: the individual-level variable and team-level dispersion. Findings at the individual level indicated that extraversion and cognitive ability were predictors of the initial level of leadership efficacy, and emotional stability, agreeableness, and openness to experience were predictors of the change in leadership efficacy over time. Midpoint feedback received by the team was also related to leadership efficacy. Findings at the team level indicated that dispersion increased over time within teams, but teams that began their lifespan with strong action and transition processes experienced less dispersion from the outset. Also, more positive midpoint feedback caused greater dispersion in the second half of the team's life. Implications for leadership development are discussed.

Based on data underlying the Beyond Grey Pinstripes survey we find: (1) that business schools doubled the number of ethics-related courses in different disciplines between 2005 and 2009; (2) that about 75{\%} of all offered courses are electives; and (3) that integration of ethics varies considerably between disciplines with management-related courses exposing students more often to ethical questions. Further, we find that (2) and (3) hardly change over time. We argue that these results point toward a problem: Business schools increasingly risk creating a gap between their upbeat rhetoric around ethics education and their actual MBA curriculum. Such decoupling is likely to emerge because schools face a tension between increasing institutional pressures to legitimize their MBA programs and internal impediments to fully integrate ethics into the curriculum. We suggest that more effective ethics education requires structural changes to the curriculum, in particular more mandatory ethics courses and a stronger integration of ethics-related debates into disciplines such as finance and accounting.

The study was conducted among 212 management students and professionals who partook in an experiential CQ education intervention encompassing cross-cultural contact as part of a university management course. The results of our work reveal that the relationship between participants' perception of optimal cross-cultural contact and CQ development is mediated by the experience of expectancy disconfirmation. When participants perceived optimal cross-cultural contact, which involved a number of conditions including equal status among participants, personalized contact, establishment of common goals, and support of the contact by authorities, they were more likely to experience expectancy disconfirmation.

Over 6,000 students from nearly 80 universities in 43 countries worked in global virtual teams for 2 months as part of their international management courses. Multisource longitudinal data were collected, including student and instructor feedback, course evaluations, assessment of changes in knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors following the experiential project, and various indicators of individual and team performance. Drawing on experiential learning, social learning, and intergroup contact theories, the effectiveness of the experiential global virtual teambased approach in international management education was evaluated at the levels of reactions, learning, attitudes, behaviors, and performance. The findings show positive outcomes at each level, but also reveal challenges and limitations of using global virtual team projects for learning and education. Implications for international management education and suggestions for future research are discussed.

Using a variety of experiential and work-based creative pedagogical and logistical approaches, these programs emphasize core elements frequently overlooked in management education, including (1) reflective practices that develop awareness, the will to manage, and what some call ""heart and soul;"" (2) systems thinking, integration, and understanding of how to work effectively in today's globalized world; and (3) application of these attributes to understanding and implementing the broad responsibilities, purposes, and (ethical) values associated with businesses and other organizations.

We argue that this approach is narrow and insufficient, and thereby threatens the credibility and long-term sustainability of the management research community. We offer a solution in the form of a broader and novel conceptual and measurement framework of scholarly impact: a pluralist perspective. It proposes actions that depart from the current win-lose and zerosum views that lead to false trade-offs such as research versus practice, rigor versus relevance, and research versus service. Our proposed pluralist conceptualization can be instrumental in enabling business schools and other academic units to clarify their strategic direction in terms of which stakeholders they are trying to affect and why, the way future scholars are trained, and the design and implementation of faculty performance management systems. We argue that the adoption of a pluralist conceptualization of scholarly impact can increase motivation for engaged scholarship and design-science research that is more conducive to actionable knowledge as opposed to exclusive career-focused advances, enhance the relevance and value of our scholarship, and thereby help to narrow the much-lamented chasm between research and practice.

A thematic analysis of student reflections (N = 96) based on their experience of material presented in their Business Ethics/Corporate Social Responsibility modules, interpreted through the framework of Ajzen's theory of planned behavior, revealed that while negative role models led to intentions to avoid unethical behavior and engage in ethical practices such as ethical purchasing, they also increased cynicism and undermined students' self-efficacy in the ethical business domain. Exposure to positive role models offset the negative consequences arising from negative role models, protecting against reduced selfefficacy by showing that unethical behavior is neither necessary nor inevitable in business, thus undermining the common justification for unethical behavior that ""everybody does it."" PRMs increased awareness that business can be both ethical and profitable and provided inspirational role models that led to increased intentions to engage in ethical business practices. With reference to social-psychological literature, these results suggest that positive role models are necessary to counter the impression created by negative role models that ethical business is unachievable or unlikely, as such beliefs can become self-fulfilling.","BADEN, DENISE",-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"BADEN, DENISE",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,4,154,170,

Because organizations need to select interpersonally competent individuals who can successfully engage in interactions immediately upon hire, students must acquire effective interpersonal skills before entering the workforce. To help achieve this goal, we utilize a taxonomy of interpersonal skills derived from a comprehensive review of the literature to recommend educational techniques that instructors can use to add interpersonal skills training in their teaching.

Our teaching method is a variant of problem-based learning, a method originally developed to teach evidence-based medicine. Following this method, students learn an evidence-based problem-solving cycle for addressing business cases. In executing this cycle, students use and produce scientific evidence through literature searches and the design of local, experimental tests of causal hypotheses. We argue the value of teaching EBMgt with a focus on producing local evidence, how it can be taught, and what can be taught. We conclude by outlining our contribution to the literature on teaching EBMgt and by discussing limitations of our approach.

We argue that an annual case competition should be established that embodies an evidence-based management (EBMgt) perspective. We extend previous suggestions about adapting casebased teaching to better support EBMgt (e.g., Goodman {\&} O'Brien, 2012; Rousseau {\&} McCarthy, 2007), recognizing that such a shift requires a fundamental change to how many business educators use cases (Mesney, 2013).

We conducted a randomized controlled field intervention with a theory-based 3-day program to increase personal initiative (using a pretest-posttest design and a randomized waiting control group). The sample consists of 100 small business owners in Africa (Kampala, Uganda). The intervention increased personal initiative behavior and entrepreneurial success over a 12-month period after the intervention. An increase in personal initiative behavior was responsible for the increase of entrepreneurial success (full mediation). Thus, the training led to an entrepreneurial mind-set and to an active approach toward entrepreneurial tasks.

We review relevant literatures from information sciences and medical education to examine the lessons learned and explore how they can inform the design and practice of evidence-based management education. We focus our review specifically on bibliographic search training because searching academic literatures to locate the best available research evidence is central to the practice of evidence-based management. Research shows that searchers often have great difficulty developing effective search strategies and retrieving relevant information from electronic databases. Despite wide variation in research designs and training programs, studies examining the effectiveness of bibliographic search training show that training typically enhances search quality. Although the extant research is informative, on its own it provides insufficient guidance for the design of bibliographic search training. Therefore, we use a combination of our findings from the literature reviewed and Goodman and O'Brien's (2012) evidence-based instructional strategies to develop a set of recommendations for designing bibliographic search training for evidence-based management education.

Our theoretical process model displays five factors contributing to the students' living moral code, which in turn influences student moral development outcomes; the five factors include institutional moral reinforcement, service activities, experiential challenges, moral amplifiers and an evolving moral identity. Research findings offer insight toward a comprehensive approach to student ethics reform. They also reveal that the student state of moral development is not bankrupt; students are looking for guidance and participation in their moral development, while at the same time holding specific expectations for the institution and its agents.

We propose that entrepreneurship education might be particularly valuable for prisoners because self-employment as an occupational career path can help overcome potential employers' discriminatory attitudes toward ex-prisoners, and by developing an entrepreneurial mindset, individuals whose career paths have been terminated can begin to form an attitudinal foundation from which to rebuild a future. Using a multiple case study method to analyze 12 participants of a European prison entrepreneurship educational program, we find that without a ""personal agency mind-set--namely, the set of assumptions, belief systems, and self-regulation capabilities through which individuals intentionally exercise influence (i.e., act) as opposed to residing as a discrete entity (i.e., acted upon)-prisoners were unable to make sense of the past or orient themselves toward the future, both of which are necessary to identify and develop opportunities and ultimately to persist with an entrepreneurship educational program. Rather than being an outcome of an entrepreneurship education program, recognizing a potential opportunity was a critical input to successful completion. We found that recognizing a potential opportunity is an important vehicle for transforming prisoners' attitudes toward entrepreneurship, imprisonment, and other individuals.

Drawing from theories on social loafing, social compensation, and trait activation, I propose that both the level of conscientiousness and agreeableness in teams could compensate for social loafing tendencies, in terms of team performance. In a study among newly formed student teams (N = 209 teams; n = 644 persons) working on a complex task that exceeded their current skill level, I found support for this idea. Consistent with predictions, social loafing tendencies were positively related to team performance when the level of conscientiousness was high rather than low. A significant 3-way interaction between social loafing tendencies, conscientiousness, and agreeableness in predicting team performance indicated that especially if there is a high degree of conscientiousness and agreeableness within the team, team members will compensate for social loafing tendencies, and performance will stay up to par. If there is little tendency to social loaf, the level of conscientiousness becomes less important, while agreeableness stays important for team performance. Given the extensive use of team projects in business schools, the implications of these findings are discussed.

Briefly reviewing the (somewhat limited) literature on judgment in management studies, we conclude that its mainly rationalist orientation prevents us (scholars and practitioners alike) from properly grasping important features of the hermeneutical-developmental process involved in coming to a judgment. In particular, the role of emotions, moral agency, language use, and, especially, the selective and integrative nature of perceptual processes, are far too easily ignored. We make the case for a particular notion of judgment understood as Aristotelian ""phronesis"" (practical wisdom). Phronetic leaders, we argue, are people who, in their search for a way out of their difficulties, have developed a refined capacity to intuitively grasp salient features of ambiguous situations and to constitute a ""landscape"" of possible paths of response, while driven by the pursuit of the notion of the common good.

Yet, research that corroborates the assumed learning outcomes, particularly with respect to advancing multicultural competence, is inconclusive. Null-to-small effect sizes are often reported and are based on unidimensional assessments of multicultural competence that have limited our knowledge of the benefits of academic work abroad. Building on Earley and Ang's (2003) conceptualization of cultural intelligence (CQ), we test the effect of studying abroad on the metacognitive, cognitive, motivational, and behavioral dimensions of multicultural competence. Following a pretest-posttest design, we tracked 84 business students who completed academic coursework abroad. To isolate the effect of the sojourn, we controlled for individual and contextual variables that might influence learning outcomes. Results confirm the multidimensional nature of our dependent variable and indicate that studying abroad acts differently on its dimensions. While participants exhibited development of the cognitive-based components of the competence, studying abroad was innocuous in advancing participants' motivational and behavioral cultural intelligence. We discuss the theoretical implications of these outcomes in light of existing conceptualizations of multicultural competence, as well as their practical implications for academic efforts that seek to advance global competencies in management education.

Using this integration, we then explore simulation-based training as a means to teach and assess crisis management team capabilities. We describe the design, development, and implementation of a simulation for crisis management teams, and discuss future applications of simulation-based training for crisis management education.

Although prior studies have explored the factors that influence knowledge-sharing intention, few studies have investigated the factors that affect the intention to withhold knowledge. This study aims to investigate the factors that affect students' knowledge-withholding intention in the context of undergraduate management education by integrating the concepts of the Big Five personality traits, social identity theory, and social exchange theory. Data collected from 365 undergraduate management students in Taiwanese universities were tested against the research model using the structural equation modeling approach. The results indicate that perceived social identity, expected rewards, and expected associations directly affect knowledge-withholding intention, and that extraversion, conscientiousness, neuroticism, and openness to experience indirectly influence knowledge-withholding intention through the mediation of perceived social identity. In addition, expected associations enhance the negative effect of perceived social identity on knowledge-withholding intention. The findings provide several important theoretical and practical implications regarding students' knowledge-withholding behaviors in the context of management education.

Since a landmark colloquium convened by Boland and Collopy in 2004, interest in ""design thinking"" has gained ground in both the academic and practitioner communities. This has led to some notable educational innovations, but overall progress remains desultory, and the danger arises that design thinking may be seen as another management fad. This essay reports an imaginary dialogue between Socrates and a novice manager (Archarios) that reaffirms the continuing relevance of the design perspective in management education and practice. Design science is well-established in the field of information systems (IS), and it is argued that IS research provides a valuable repository of design theory and techniques. The dialogue provides real illustrations, from health and social care in the UK, of ""design disasters"" which could have been averted had managers adopted a ""design attitude"" and followed principles of good design methodology in their professional practice.","WASTELL, DAVID",-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"WASTELL, DAVID",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,4,641,652,

The informal management curriculum is a potentially powerful factor in student learning, and our field's current lack of discussion about it suggests that we are not using its influence as well as we might. We offer a definition of the informal management curriculum, including a comparison to related constructs. Our definition provides the foundation for a conversation among three management education experts, Kenneth G. Brown, Rakesh Khurana, and Robert S.

We hypothesized that a set of action-regulatory factors mediates the effect of the training on entrepreneurial action. We evaluated the training's impact over a 12-month period using a randomized control group design. As hypothesized, the training had positive effects on action-regulatory factors (entrepreneurial goal intentions, action planning, action knowledge, and entrepreneurial self-efficacy) and the action-regulatory factors mediated the effect of the training on entrepreneurial action. Furthermore, entrepreneurial action and business opportunity identification mediated the effect of the training on business creation.

Our work focuses on students with a non-native English-language background in a business school setting. Although proponents argue that EMI generally increases graduates' employability, they do not sufficiently consider that study strategies differ substantially across social milieus and between the sexes. Failing to account for cultural distance of students to the educational system in choosing EMI can foster social inequality and contribute to the reproduction of elites. Using a survey, we conduct a quasi-experiment in two identical bachelor's degree programs that differ only in their instruction language. Using structural equation modeling, we find that students from higher social strata are much more likely to choose EMI. As suggested by the Bourdieusian perspective, this relationship is not directly observable but operates through hidden mechanisms, such as cultural capital (relative English proficiency) and a better sense of gaming and positioning (career orientation). Business students from the lowest stratum self-select against EMI due to a pronounced fear of failure despite their awareness that EMI leads to higher employability. Our findings support the successful introduction of EMI while ensuring social equality.

Because a large proportion of the costs are borne by employers, organizations need to develop effective responses. We frame dealing with employee mental health issues as a reasonably common, but complex, managerial job demand that requires adequate preparation. Hence, we position the development of applied management knowledge (AMK) for effectively managing employee mental health issues as a critical objective for management education. Our study presents an analysis of qualitative data related to managers' experiences of working with an employee with a mental health issue that identifies forms of knowledge used and needed in these situations. Our findings indicate that managers reference specific forms of conceptual and procedural knowledge when (1) becoming aware of the employee's mental health issue; (2) exploring the workplace implications and developing an action response; (3) implementing the response and managing it as an ongoing situation, and (4) engaging in reflective learning. In order to begin the work of curriculum development, we provide a preliminary discussion of educational strategies that may aid in the development of this form of AMK and outline a number of priorities for future research and practice.

In the ""dominant view"" of popularization in the sociology of science, the process of popularization is understood as a one-way movement of ideas from the field of science to the general public. Thus, it is seen as unlikely to influence management research. However, more recent research has challenged the assumptions of this view and has offered an alternative perspective, which can be termed the ""revised view"" of popularization. In this view, interactions between science and popularization media are much more complex, and relevant feedback effects from popularization media to scholarly journals are possible. Against this theoretical background, we investigate the role played by an important example of popularization media in the field of management, the Harvard Business Review, in management discourse. Using a bibliometric analysis of 231 Harvard Business Review articles, we analyze the degree, direction, and type of intellectual influence of the publication. Our findings suggest that this magazine's role differs significantly from the traditional view of popularization. According to our results, the Harvard Business Review is not only a widely quoted scientific source, but it also has a significant impact on the scientific discourse in management research.

This allows for conclusions to be drawn about the quantity, quality, relevance, and meaning of the available evidence. Although conducting such reviews is important for EBMgt and academically, the skills required are rarely taught. Drawing on our experiences of teaching courses on conducting rapid systematic reviews to a range of students, we include four goals here. First, we describe the nature and purposes of systematic reviews and consider the multiple benefits of teaching students how to perform them. Second, we describe a course on rapid systematic reviews delivered to a group of master's students. Third, we report students' reactions to different aspects of the course and the outcomes for students and teachers. Last, we discuss the implications of these experiences for teaching systematic review skills across business school curricula and how they may in the future play a more prominent role in developing EBMgt skills in students and in management education more generally.

Therefore, I conducted a study that examined the effects of technological, pedagogical, and student characteristics on student learn ing in Internet-based MBA courses. Of these characteristics, I found that only those reflecting instructor efforts to create an interactive classroom environment were significantly associated with student learning. Other characteristics such as the perceived ease of use of the course software package, the perceived flexibility of the online classroom environment, and the amount of time students spent logged onto the course Website were not significantly associated with student learning. These findings suggest that while some level of technological sophistication may be important, teaching expertise may be the primary criterion for teaching success in the online classroom environment. Therefore, instructors may need to spend more time developing and cultivating instructional skills such as simultaneously working with several smaller groups of students, developing interesting discussion questions, and fostering intimacy. To support this faculty development, business schools will likely need to make substantial infrastructural investments to ensure that their online course offerings are pedagogically and technologically conducive to student learning. ","Arbaugh, J B",-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Arbaugh, J B",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,2,9,26,
14,Business Communication Quarterly ,Ethical Preferences among Business Leaders: Implications for Business Schools,2000,63,1,23--31,,,http://bcq.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/63/1/23," Since 1976, the American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) has encouraged business schools to include ethics in their curricula. Because lan guage is the means for conveying values, including ethical values, business com munication faculty play an important role in deciding what should be taught, and how. But until very recently, most researchers failed to look specifically at actual practices and perceptions in the workplace. To address that need, we conducted a survey of 250 business leaders concerning their ethical preferences and compared our results with an earlier study of business faculty and students. The survey, adapted from one used in the Arthur Andersen Business Ethics Program, consists of 20 narratives which presented respondents with the need to judge the impor tance of certain issues and their approval or disapproval of the action or decision described. We found no significant differences in responses to the 14 items which addressed ethical issues in such areas as creating health and environmental risks, taking credit when credit is not due, focusing on disability issues, deceiving cus tomers with products and services, and using insider information to gain personal advantage. We did find significant differences in responses to six narratives focused on ignoring wrongdoing in the workplace, doing special favors for others to gain personal advantage, and covering up flaws in merchandise or operations. Our results, and the survey instrument itself, provide useful tools for the business com munication classroom. ","Conaway, Roger N; Fernandez, Thomas L",17,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Conaway, Roger N","Fernandez, Thomas L",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,3,23,31,

To use an American-based behavioural simulation, Looking Glass Inc.,  in Hong Kong, we needed to adapt it to the students' language environment and proficiency, their culturally derived behaviours, and their understanding of the context of American business. In Hong Kong, the norms prescribing language use are complex and contradictory; English is a major business, government, and legal language, but Cantonese and sometimes Mandarin have a continuing presence, especially in oral communication. The English in the simulation, however, reflect ing the authors' emphasis on realism, included slang and idiomatic expressions that were confusing even to students otherwise fluent in the language, and thus we had to modify materials to aid comprehension. We also had to adjust our administra tion of the materials to account for cultural differences between the individualistic and low power distance dimensions of the American scene represented in the sim ulation and the collectivistic and high power distance environment our students found more comfortable. Our strategy in adapting the simulation was to stimulate participants in Looking Glass Inc.  to act authentically in their roles, negate reac tive and promote proactive behaviour at all four organisational levels, and encour age the thoughtful and complete analysis of the simulation, not something that came naturally. Finally, we had to make explicit several elements of American business assumed by the authors but not known to the students, including Ameri can geography and transportation systems, laws and administrative bodies, and race and gender issues. ","Du-Babcock, Bertha; Babcock, Richard D",19,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Du-Babcock, Bertha","Babcock, Richard D",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,2,9,40,

Yet in reality effective lis tening is a skill that needs to be developed as a prerequisite for successful practice of the more 'active' skills of speaking and writing. The insurance industry is a prime example of an industry that relies heavily on good listening skills for effective marketing. We conducted a study in Singapore of how listening is perceived by people involved in insurance. We found that more experienced people were well aware of its key role although students majoring in insurance believed speaking was more important. This study confirms earlier research: in the insurance indus try in Singapore there is a gap between the perceived need for good listening and the degree to which good listening skills are perceived to be possessed by insurance agents. ","Goby, Valerie Priscilla; Lewis, Justus Helen",24,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Goby, Valerie Priscilla","Lewis, Justus Helen",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,3,41,51,

International business communication students need to be aware of such differences on substantive issues. Second, critical pedagogy maintains that making students think and revisit their worldviews through an encounter with discomforting or decentering ideas is a valuable teaching and learn ing tool.

14,Business Communication Quarterly ,Differences in American and British Vocabulary: Implications for International Business Communication,2000,63,4,27--39,,,http://bcq.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/63/4/27," American English and British English vocabularies have diverged over time, result, ing in lexical differences that have the potential to confound English-language intercultural communication. The differences derive from the need to adapt the meanings of existing expressions or to find new expressions for different things and to borrow expressions from different cultures. Separation and slow means of com munication also cause differences and encourage one side to retain archaic expres sions that others have abandoned or modified. The differences in vocabulary can be grouped into four categories: the same expression with differences in style, con notation, and/or frequency; the same expression with one or more shared and dif ferent meanings; the same expression with completely different meanings; and dif ferent expressions with the same shared meaning. These differences in vocabularies affect understanding of all varieties of English. To bridge differences in Enghsh language vocabularies, international business communication teachers and trainers must devote more attention to English as the dominant language of international business, create awareness of important vocabulary differences that have the potential to confound intercultural communication, and develop and teach strate gies for bridging the vocabulary differences of English speakers. ","Scott, James Calvert",-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Scott, James Calvert",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,3,27,39,

We recently took a different approach. We asked business professionals to critique and evaluate a set of writing samples. We then asked business faculty to evaluate the same samples, and we analyzed the results from the two groups. We found that professionals judge writing on different criteria than do faculty. While both groups emphasize organization, professionals also emphasize wording/style, content, and sentence structure more than do faculty, who emphasize conciseness, spelling/grammar, appearance, and purpose. In addition, professionals are signifi cantly more lenient in assigning grades than are faculty and spend less time in evaluating the writing. In general, business professionals judge papers more on substance (content) and less on style (mechanics) than do business faculty. ","Seshadri, Srivatsa; Theye, Larry D",19,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Seshadri, Srivatsa","Theye, Larry D",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,2,9,23,

To test this hypothesis, we analyzed transcripts of job interviews involving nine English-speaking applicants from Chinese backgrounds and two experienced interviewers from Anglo-American MNCs in Singapore. Our assumption was that a person's cultural background and upbringing influence his or her perform ance at job interviews. The findings reveal that Chinese applicants tend to defer to the interviewer (i.e. superior) and focus on the group or family, besides being averse to self-assertion. Hence, applicants from a Chinese background may be dis advantaged when being interviewed for jobs with MNCs which are heavily influ enced by Anglo-American culture. ","Wong, Irene F H; Phooi-Ching, Lai",16,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Wong, Irene F H","Phooi-Ching, Lai",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,2,9,22,

The approach is based on the concept of schemata (Rumelhart, 1980; Cook, 1994) and on Swales's (1990) techniques for genre analysis. It is divided into four interrelated teaching stages: background information, communicative purposes, text structure, and the implica tions of genre comparisons. Among the four stages, teaching the communicative purposes is the most important. This approach has been used effectively to teach students how to write sales letters in English and Chinese. ","Yunxia, Zhu",-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Yunxia, Zhu",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,3,49,68,

Most rhetorical models consider only the writing center as occupying the middle ground between students and teaching faculty. A revision of that model, one in which the writing center and teaching faculty share the middle ground, is more appropriate for a business writing center. Moreover, writing assignments best serve business student writers when students must situate themselves within the discourse community of a post-graduation employer. Instead of fostering an adversarial relationship, business writing centers function most effectively for students when the center complements the classroom faculty. ","Griffin, Frank",-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Griffin, Frank",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,3,70,79,

Instructors see greater improvement in student writing skills than do students. To close this gap, faculty should offer more explicit explanations of the assignment and of the con cepts to be learned and the skills to be improved.

In developing a course with a majority of non-Western participants at The University of Waikato, we adapted critical pedagogy to address the Western biases in the texts and approaches of intercultural communication. We selected both mainstream and alternative readings that allowed students to connect the field's neo-colonial business present with its colonialist past, to question the ethics and efficacy of an often skewed territorialisation of knowledge; and to redress tra ditional distortions by introducing perspectives from a range of critical and post colonial theorists. The readings were reinforced by student presentations of their own experiences crossing cultural borders.

Writing-across-the-curriculum programs have met with mixed success. We wanted to see how elements of such a program were working at our university. Through a survey of faculty, we found the pres ence of both formal and informal writing policies, differences in standards for writ ing in upper-division core courses, differences in assignments, differences in assess ment strategies and in the results of such assessments, and, finally, differences in perceptions about whether WAC is a good idea. In general, faculty do provide opportunities for students to write, but many feel students write poorly and thus can handle only easy assignments, and many faculty consider themselves ineffec tive teachers of writing. Based on this study we recommend the implementation of team-taught, interdisciplinary courses; the development of standards for writing and assessment ; and training programs for faculty who want to integrate writing into their courses. ","Plutsky, Susan; Wilson, Barbara A",15,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Plutsky, Susan","Wilson, Barbara A",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,3,26,41,

Some of the insights on politeness, tact, and def erence found in the work of Brown and Levinson, Leech, and Fraser and Nolen can help provide guidelines for assessing how important a you-attitude may be in writing about a particular real-world situation, and case grammar and information structure can inform strategies to enhance the expression of a you-attitude. Rather than being a binary variable, you-attitude appears to be gradable, and an infor mal student assessment of the you-attitude expressed in ten versions of the same passage suggests that the various strategies for enhancing the you-attitude conveyed by a text appear to have a cumulative effect, so that a greater sense of you-attitude is created when more strategies are used. ","Rodman, Lilita",-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Rodman, Lilita",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,2,9,25,

A review of literature and a survey of students in upper-level business communication courses at Central Missouri State University provide evidence for five strategies to assist students in dealing with team-interaction situations: 1. Instruct students in techniques to avoid groupthink and to promote and handle competition 2. Offer students ideas on and methods for reaching agreement in a timely manner 3. Vary the subject of group writing assignments to allow each student to be perceived as an expert 4. Encourage all students to be active participants in the group process 5. Emphasize the importance of good writing skills to both males and females.

Thus educators need to determine the most effective and efficient methods of communicating with distance students. An examination of e-mail messages sent to the instructor of an MBA class by dis tance students reveals that the volume of messages sent depends on students' tech nology proficiency, ability to process and seek out information, topic affinity, and relational needs. Furthermore, the findings reveal that an instructor can decrease the volume of messages received by researching the student population, communi cating proactively, and taking advantage of the messaging system's tools. ","Hartman, Jackie; Lewis, Jeffrey S; Powell, Karen Sterkel",16,34,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Hartman, Jackie","Lewis, Jeffrey S","Powell, Karen Sterkel",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,2,9,28,

This diversity may sometimes lead to problems for business communication teachers who must assess the written communication skills of students who may not be fluent in English. To address these problems, we conducted a nationwide survey of business communication teachers, soliciting input on how ESL students' written communication skills were assessed. Respondents were asked to identify areas where their assessments of ESL students might differ from their assessments of stu dents whose first language was English. Comparisons were made based upon teachers' gender, age, number of years of teaching experience, and geographic location where they teach. Although some grading leniency was shown toward ESL students in specific areas, generally the respondents indicated that they do not assess business communication assignments any differently based upon the stu dents' primary language usage. ","Lewis, Stephen D; McGrew, Linda G; Adams, C Nathan",17,34,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Lewis, Stephen D","McGrew, Linda G","Adams, C Nathan",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,3,30,42,

The top five skills sought, not unexpectedly, are 1: communication (oral and written); 2. computer literacy; 3. interpersonal/social; 4. critical thinking/leadership (tied); and 5. teamwork. Recruiters still favored the resume and interview as methods for demonstrating these skills, but they also felt a portfolio was useful in providing evidence of these skills in context.

The internal proposal (also known as the justification report), on the other hand, is applicable for almost any student's future career. It provides an opportunity for students to develop the competence and confidence to express their ideas in the workplace, encouraging them to demonstrate awareness and initiative, utilize problem-solving skills, and create a persuasive strategy.

Results indicate that department chairs perceive writing skills to be more important to business communication courses than other communication skills, such as speaking, tech nology-mediated communication, interpersonal communication, team/group com munication, listening, and cultural literacy skills.

This campaign was motivated by govemment perception and media reports of a decline in English language skills.  Using a 40-item questionnaire, this study investigated whether faculty at a large Singapore business school shared similar perceptions of inadequate communi cation skills, in this case among undergraduates, and also sought to explain their perceptions. The findings indicate that the faculty perceived undergraduate com munication skills to be in need of improvement, thus lending support to employer and government criticism. An analysis of survey responses revealed some probable underlying causes for faculty perceptions, including an apparent lack of real com mitment to the improvement of such skills. ","Wharton, Glenn",-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Wharton, Glenn",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,3,39,54,

A minority applicant's name, address, education, work history, extracurricular activities, and choice of references may trigger unfavorable assumptions by the reader and unfairly influence the selection process. To reduce the chances of ""detection"" and being eliminated prematurely, some minority students Anglicize their names, use street addresses of relatives and friends in more desirable parts of town, and downplay ethnic-specific education, jobs, and affiliations. Concealing one's ethnic background, however, may be difficult and, more important, may be counterproductive. Minority students should write resumes that are accurate and accentuate the achievements that a potential employer would focus on. Business communication instructors should address concerns about discrimination in selection and hiring as they help all students choose the appropriate resume format and language to present their best selves.","Davis, Barbara D; Muir, Clive",17,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Davis, Barbara D","Muir, Clive",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,3,39,50,

Yet the pedagogical literature geared toward helping appli cants respond to these unique interviewing questions has not kept pace. Evidence shows that behavioral description questions require respondents to tell stories and that storytelling is now critical to applicants' success in employment interviews. We present criteria by which to judge the effectiveness of applicants' stories and demonstrate how business communication instructors might use these criteria to help applicants tell better stories. Specifically, the criteria presented in this article are : To what degree is a story internally consistent? To what degree is a story con sistent with facts the listener holds to be true? To what degree is a story relevant to the question asked and the claim being made? To what degree is a story univocal? To what degree does a story provide details that support the claim being made? How does the way a story is told reflect the teller's beliefs and values? ","Ralston, Steven M; Kirkwood, William G; Burant, Patricia A",18,39,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Ralston, Steven M","Kirkwood, William G","Burant, Patricia A",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,2,8,22,

Highlighting these areas allows business communication teachers to focus on the critical use of technology in online formats that entail relatively new teaching media. The critical application of technology use can be seen in areas like tool evaluation and use, power and divisions of labor, and community participation.","Walker, Kristin",-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Walker, Kristin",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,3,55,67,

However, improving writing skills, especially with respect to punctuation, grammar, and word choice, often requires substantial teacher time and effort. To assess and improve student writing skills in a time-efficient manner, the authors developed a computer-scored measure of students' ability to edit for writing mechanics. The authors tested the method with a pretest and posttest design and found that when students were held accountable for improvement (with 5{\%} of the course grade dependent on improvement), there was a significant increase in students' ability to edit. Without that accountability, improvement did not occur.

The most important outcome of the survey is that a vast majority of the respondents prefer a modest layout. Most students dislike sounds and animations in a slide show. Another outcome, however, is that audiences may be inclined to evaluate as positive any feature they were exposed to. Still, this apparent compliance does not mean that speakers can do whatever they like. Audience preferences do affect their evaluation of a lecture, and thus instructors should, as always, keep their audience in mind when they choose to use PowerPoint. ","Blokzijl, Wim; Naeff, Roos",14,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Blokzijl, Wim","Naeff, Roos",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,3,70,77,

This article discusses the rationale and logistics of two models for conducting such projects. One model, used at Clemson University, is a formal academic consultancy service in which students are paid for their work with for-profit businesses. Another, used at the University of North Texas, also incorporates for-profit clients but operates in the more traditional classroom setting where student teams are not paid for their work. Whatever the approach, client projects facilitate communication between academia and business, enlist the services of professionals in a variety of fields to help shape the education of future graduates, offer opportunities for students to gain practical experience that surpasses any classroom simulation or case study, and keep instructors in touch with business trends and practices. ","Cooke, Lynne; Williams, Sean",13,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Cooke, Lynne","Williams, Sean",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,4,139,152,

Students felt that the specialist, stand-alone communication program was more effective than their 3 to 4-year degree per se in delivering communication instruction, but certain business fields (e.g., actuarial science) felt this more strongly than others (e.g., information systems). The implications are that expert tuition is essential and that a customized, more nuanced approach will ensure greater job literacy. Experiential teaching strategies that encourage student voice; workshop diversity; real-life scenarios; and supportive, scaffolding marking interventions will further consolidate skills development. In particular, communication teachers need to work with students and other stakeholders to deepen understanding of computer-mediated communications (CMC) and the expanded needs of a multicultural global society.

Executives for whom English is a second language often face special challenges communicating in such settings. This study examines how 115 executives in a distance-learning business communication class in Mexico used English to conduct business and their perceived strengths and weaknesses in the language. Although most executives used English regularly at work and in their classes, many continued to have language problems. They cited vocabulary, writing, and grammar as critical areas to improve, followed by pronunciation and speaking. Their audiences consisted of native and nonnative speakers of English who faced their own language challenges. E-mail and phone were the most commonly used channels for English communication. The study results have implications for teaching international students in U.S. MBA and international executive programs. They give insight into the English language use and into the needs of managers overseas. Instructors can use a needs assessment to identify and target language challenges, develop class activities to address problems, and provide remediation in language need areas. ","Grosse, Christine Uber",-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Grosse, Christine Uber",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,2,7,23,

Thirteen ethnic Chinese students in a New Zealand university business school participated in an 18-month ethnographic study. The findings indicate that these students were not prepared for the dialogic nature of classroom communication, which created difficulties in listening, understanding, and interacting. Written assignments embodied different expectations of writing styles, and understandings of critical analysis and plagiarism. The findings raise challenges for teachers in responding to difference rather than deficit approaches to teaching and learning, for ethnic Chinese students to be better prepared for the new learning environment, and for host institutions and local students to find ways of developing diversity awareness and appreciation. ","Holmes, Prue",-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Holmes, Prue",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,4,294,307,

The meaning-as-event analytical method, from reader-response narrative theory, reveals specific language features through which business texts manifest readers and writers.

An analysis of this process makes three contributions to communities of practice scholarship: It documents catalyzing circumstances for CoP creation, places the Ph.D. quest in the context of existing CoP theory, and identifies a critical point that precedes CoP formation in the existing CoP model. Highlighting the shared experience of postgraduate students opens up opportunities for CoP formation that can help students emerge from isolation into a supportive peer community. ","Janson, Annick; Howard, Laurie",15,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Janson, Annick","Howard, Laurie",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,4,168,181,

Benefits include preparing students for the workplace by immersing them in intercultural projects and increasing the complexity of their understanding of the global economy. Challenges can range from technological constraints and scarce resources to geopolitical factors and varying disciplinary norms. However, global partnerships make faculty and students more aware of and engaged in the global business environment as they learn to communicate more effectively across cultures, critique current business practices, and produce new ways of being in global relation to each other. An interinstitutional partnership between a U.S. university and Universidad de la Habana in Cuba forms the centerpiece of discussion. Outcomes of this partnership include coauthoring articles in both countries and languages, the creation of a business communication course for graduate students in Cuba, and the development of classroom activities in which selected U.S. and Cuban undergraduate students exchange business documents. ","Sapp, David Alan",-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Sapp, David Alan",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,4,267,280,

On another dimension of interest, however, students in the online hybrid course demonstrated a higher rate of active learning practices in their use of Blackboard course management software. Perhaps most important, online writing instruction yielded as significant levels of measurable improvement in writing as did instruction in a traditional classroom, provided that instructional materials corresponded to the particular needs of the students. These results are encouraging in indicating that online courses may provide the best form of course delivery for certain students and certain communication practices.

Given the importance of culturally acceptable spelling, the need to be aware of and sensitive to cultural differences, and strong reactions to variation in spelling, it is important to understand the differences in these two spelling systems. Families of words that illustrate spelling practices draw attention to differences between the American and British spelling systems. Under at least some circumstances, business communicators should accommodate for spelling differences when communicating with those from other cultures. Implementing the presented teaching ideas based upon reacting, discussing, adapting, researching, and writing can clarify understanding of the American and British business-related spelling systems and help learners to prepare more culturally sensitive business documents when appropriate. ","Scott, James Calvert",-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Scott, James Calvert",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,4,153,167,

This focus on corporate strategythe language and concepts that concern the mission and direction that an organization should adoptrequires, in turn, that faculty enact several roles to assist students in developing their final assignments, strategic presentations, and reports. Faculty play the role of specialists in corporate strategy, communication specialists, and stand-ins for the primary audience(s) for these assignments. Working with students on these assignments underscores two important values in MBA education: providing students with the means to engage in discussion at the CEO level where decisions about the company's strategic direction are made, and demonstrating to students that the strategic assignments they produce belong to a larger communication campaign for getting buy-in for corporate strategy. These teaching practices foster research projects as well. ","Trifocals, Wearing",-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Trifocals, Wearing",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,4,281,293,

When conflicts arise in an online class, the activity system of the class has to be kept in balance for the course to continue functioning effectively. Activity theory and distributed learning theory are useful for studying this process of conflict resolution and online communication. Several strategies can be used to facilitate conflict resolution in online courses, based on these theories: complimenting, generalizing, and agreeing. These normalizing strategies can improve conflict resolution in online professional communication courses as well as in various online communication contexts. ","Walker, Kristin",-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Walker, Kristin",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,4,182,197,

Nearly 400 students at an AACSC Internationalaccredited business college participated in the study during their sophomore and senior years. The findings indicate that the business communication course helped students develop good skills in writing reports, solving problems, working in teams, communicating orally, and using Internet technologies for both the short term (sophomore year) and the long term (senior year). More than 95{\%} of the students reported achieving As and Bs on written assignments, company-analysis reports, problem-solving assignments, and oral presentations in their sophomore, junior, and senior years. However, the long-term effect was statistically less significant than was the short-term effect, although both were within the same positive range. ","Zhao, Jensen J; Alexander, Melody W",15,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Zhao, Jensen J","Alexander, Melody W",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,3,24,40,

One way out of this position may be an act of disciplinary border crossingaligning the field of business writing with progressive voices in business and management. This article describes a framework structured around key theoretical concepts from Senge's The Fifth Discipline: The Art and Practice of the Learning Organization (1995). Senge's text is surprisingly rhetorical, and I examine the associated framework in terms of its potential for invigorating both teaching and research in business writing, thereby building ethos for the profession. ","Amidon, Stevens R",-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Amidon, Stevens R",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,4,406,428,

Results indicate that programs typically do not require a course in visual rhetoric, and on average, 20{\%} or less of teaching in undergraduate courses is dedicated to visual communication. The findings suggest that business communication curricula may not adequately prepare students for the multimodal communication tasks they are likely to encounter in the workplace, particularly those tasks that rely on knowledge of visual rhetoric. Possible solutions include adding courses, integrating visual communication more deeply into existing courses, contextualizing existing design projects to ensure they are more than software exercises, and incorporating visual communication into other typical course projects. ","Brumberger, Eva R",-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Brumberger, Eva R",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,4,318,333,

This program was developed in response to research indicating that early career decision making and excellent career communication skills lead to better student employment choices. The Business Profession differs from traditional university career education programs in several ways. It is (a) developmental: It offers learner-centered programming over a 4-year period covering topics that match students' growing career maturity; (b) cocurricular: It is offered as a cocurricular supplement to the academic business program; (c) mandatory: Business majors are required to complete this program as a graduation prerequisite; and (d) faculty directed: A tenured business communication faculty serves as director. Evaluations indicate students find the program valuable in helping them create a career plan that relates academic learning to real-world needs. ","Clark, Thomas",-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Clark, Thomas",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,4,271,289,

Because current research suggests immediacy behaviors may indeed be present, we developed a strategy for measuring immediacy in an online MBA course and related the results to student grades on final team projects in the course. Learner-to-learner, noncontent-related statements showed minimal affective behavior, but that lack did not have a negative effect on grades. The study suggests that students do not automatically provide supportive feedback, compliment each other, and express appreciation or agreement unless the instructor builds a learning community and transfers interactive roles to the students themselves. ","Conaway, Roger N; Easton, Susan S; Schmidt, Wallace V",17,34,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Conaway, Roger N","Easton, Susan S","Schmidt, Wallace V",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,3,23,35,

Results indicate that the ability to persuade effectively was most critical to winning tasks, but leadership skills and interpersonal skills were the most common sources of praise and criticism from teammates and Donald Trump and his associates. Women appeared to be judged more critically for their interpersonal skills than men, whereas evaluations of men focused primarily on their leadership abilities. ","Kinnick, Katherine N; Parton, Sabrena R",21,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Kinnick, Katherine N","Parton, Sabrena R",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,4,429,456,

The methods of delivery, however, do not seem to follow any particular model, such as the common U.S. practice of a separate program or department. Required courses are found at 10 of the 24 schools, including two at 2 schools. Elective communication courses are offered at 8 schools, and related courses, those with a communication component, appear at all but 1 school. Communication is perceived as being an integral part of overall management development and global leadership, as opposed to a skill that could be assessed via testing or other assessment. ","Knight, Melinda",-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Knight, Melinda",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,4,139,179,

The authors found that most students report conflicts that are process or relational in nature, with few students reporting task-oriented conflict. Nearly all students report discussing the conflict with third partiesindividuals outside the organization and/or the conflictand nearly all students find these discussions helpful in resolving or working through the conflict. Based on their literature review and research, the authors developed scenarios to help students read and resolve workplace conflicts. The scenarios use conversations with people outside the conflictthird-party discussionsto help students respond appropriately to the conflict. ","Myers, Laura L; Larson, R Sam",15,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Myers, Laura L","Larson, R Sam",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,4,306,317,

The authors found that Singapore is a microcosm in terms of (a) requirements for English competency, (b) the variety of communication offerings, and (c) the lack of uniformity in the delivery of communication training. Whereas Singaporean MBA/EMBA programs sit in a highly internationalized environment with substantial foreign student intake, and whereas Singapore is known for adopting best practices in education from around the world, communication training for management evidences a veneer of Asian content and imitation rather than innovation. These findings caused the authors to rethink what they have traditionally regarded as management communication and to consider the need for further internationalization, not only in this multicultural city-state but worldwide. ","Rogers, Priscilla S; Wong, Irene F H",20,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Rogers, Priscilla S","Wong, Irene F H",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,4,180,196,

Communication instruction was initially a stable component of the program, with a week-long course at the beginning and a report-writing workshop at the end, followed by individual instruction in preparing deliverables for a consulting field project. Since the field projects were phased out in 2003, students continue to receive the one-week communication course in Vienna; after that, they have voluntary access to individual instruction from the Center for Business Communication at the University of South Carolina and exposure to in-class communication workshops as scheduled by faculty across the business disciplines. Although student feedback is positive, these instructional methods currently lack consistency. To achieve such consistency, a communication center can help to integrate instruction within MBA programs through communication intensive courses, writing studios, or a communication capstone course.","Thomas, Martha Wetterhall; Hardy, Samuel B",26,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Thomas, Martha Wetterhall","Hardy, Samuel B",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,4,197,208,

A recent government initiative in Taiwan to encourage international education has led to the development of an international MBA program at the National Cheng Kung University in Tainan; both Chinese and Southeast Asian students participate in the program. They exhibit different behaviors in their classes, particularly in their postings in online discussion boards. For reasons that can be partly explained by the students' responses on a Chinese-Value Survey, Chinese students tend to post fewer messages than Southeast Asians, and both groups post fewer messages than Westerners in the classes under study. Instructors in multicultural classes have to consider such differences when they design assignments and set expectations for students in online discussions. ","Warden, Clyde A; Chen, Judy F; Caskey, D'Arcy",16,30,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Warden, Clyde A","Chen, Judy F","Caskey, D'Arcy",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,4,222,232,

An analysis of textbooks as disciplinary artifacts reveals that students enrolled in communication courses across the university are often presented with conflicting or contradictory ethics instruction. Commonly, business and technical communication textbooks advocate a foundational approach toward the subject, whereas interpersonal communication textbooks, as taught within the liberal arts, support a nonfoundational view. Rather than bolstering students' understanding of the importance of ethical communication, such broad-based contradictions might lead to an overall ambivalence toward the subject. A critical pedagogyone that acknowledges and explores this tacit disciplinary debate on ethicswould provide students a more comprehensive philosophical and historical basis for determining their own perspectives on ethical communication. ","Barnes, Michael C; Keleher, Michael",18,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Barnes, Michael C","Keleher, Michael",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,4,144,157,

Faculty Versus Student Perceptions of PowerPoint Use in Business Education,2006,69,4,374--396,,,http://bcq.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/69/4/374,"The use of PowerPoint (PPT)based lectures in business classes across universities is ubiquitous yet understudied in empirical pedagogical research. The purpose of this empirical study was to ascertain whether significant differences exist between faculty and student perceptions with regard to PPT's impact on perceived learning, classroom interactions, and student behaviors. The results indicated that (a) students have a significantly less favorable overall view of PPT's influence on cognitive learning and classroom interaction than faculty members; (b) unlike faculty members, students do not believe that posting notes on the Web will decrease their motivation to attend class; and (c) both faculty members and students perceive that PPT has a favorable impact on notetaking quality, content recall during exams, emphasis on key lecture points, and holding student attention during class. The authors offer implications for instructors and future research.

Students in five sections of a course in written business communication composed the control group, whereas students in two sections composed the treatment group. On the first letter each group wrote early in the semesterbefore the treatment group began error labeling in remediation exercisesno significant differences were found in the writing performance of both groups. However, on their last letter written late in the semester, studentsin the treatment group significantly reduced the number of sentence-level errors they made, compared to students in the control group. The improved writing performance of the treatment group is attributed to error labeling in conjunction with error correction in the remediation exercises. ","Quible, Zane K",-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Quible, Zane K",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,2,8,24,

Success in this complex environment depends on a shared culture that facilitates the making of knowledge and the best contributions of all team members. To prepare managers for such communication, the authors designed and implemented a semester-long intercultural virtual team project between a management communication course in the United States and one in Canada. To prevent faultlines between subgroups on each campus, the authors set a clear outcome for students' research, established equity between the two sites, structured assignments so that students worked interdependently across sites, and encouraged inclusive communication. Faculty considering such a partnership should incorporate a robust collaborative workspace, incorporate preliminary exercises before a large project, provide intensive mentoring and instruction on peer review, arrange for a real visit or videoconference between locations, and expect the project to be both fun and demanding. ","Starke-Meyerring, Doreen; Andrews, Deborah",25,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Starke-Meyerring, Doreen","Andrews, Deborah",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,3,25,49,

This study analyzes students' guided reflections in response to qualitative probes regarding CSL projects required for all MBA candidates at the study site. Data were gathered during a 5-year period from 326 reflective repor ts. More than 80{\%} of the reflective question responses were authored by international students; approximately 60{\%} of those were ESL learners. The findings reveal differences not only between ESL learners and native speakers of English but also between ESL students. Key themes discussed include cultural sensitivity, teamwork, contributive roles, conflict resolution skills, and pragmatic communication skills. The findings presented are accompanied by students' comments, corroborating literature, and teaching tips.

In fact, scores have been relatively stable since the 1980s. The proportion of students with solid writing and reading abilities has held fairly steady but remained small during the past 25 years. During this period, however, the proportion of high school graduates who enter higher education has soared. Thus, more students with weak verbal abilities now enter college. Initiatives that encourage people to continue their education have succeeded, whereas initiatives to improve writing, reading, and reasoning abilities have not. The complex causes of entering college students' weak verbal abilities include social and cultural forces as well as decisions by educational institutions. By understanding the complicated history of this issue and reframing it in positive terms, business and technical communication faculty can help effect change.

One solution to overcome the obstacles to ethics discussions among students who are geographically separated is the use of email as a mode of communication. As a basis for their discussions, the students used the accounting ethics vignette titled The Error from the Ar thur Andersen Business Ethics Program. This ar ticle repor ts on the results of the analysis of U.S. and Canadian students' responses to pre- and postquestionnaires concerning the alternatives available to the character in the ethics scenario before and after their written email discussions and group repor ts. The students did have significant changes in their responses after their discussions of the character's alternatives. It also repor ts the students' responses to a project feedback questionnaire concerning the students' perceptions of the importance of ethical training and discussions.

The authors investigate whether students in the contemporary business classroom view PPT as a novel stimulus and whether these perceptions of novelty are related to students' self-assessment of learning. Results indicate that the degree of novelty that undergraduate business students associate with PPT-based teaching significantly relates to their perceptions of PPT's impact on cognitive learning and classroom interaction. Students' views of PPT as a novel stimulus are also associated with their perception of specific constructive and dysfunctional classroom behaviors and attitudes. The authors discuss their findings and offer implications for instructors and researchers in business education.

Rejecting a psychometric assessment approach in which component features of critical thinking are disaggregated, this study is based on a holistic scoring of student memos. Students were asked to recommend and justify a course of action to a lay client facing an ill-structured finance problem. Analysis of student memos reveals critical thinking weaknesses that may be ameliorated by changes in assignments or instructional methods. The memos reveal four kinds of critical thinking problems: (a) failure to address the client's problem, (b) random rather than purposeful application of finance tools and methodologies, (c) inability to translate finance concepts or methods into lay language, and (d) inability to construct rhetorically useful graphics. The curricular implications of this study are discussed.

The authors build on previous research in which they asked students to analyze an ill-structured investment problem and recommend a course of action. The results revealed numerous critical thinking weaknesses, including a failure to address the client's problem, use analytical tools systematically, construct rhetorically useful graphics, or translate finance concepts and methodologies into lay language. The present research aims to understand more deeply why students struggle with ill-structured problems. Using think-aloud protocols, audiotaped interviews, and other strategies, the authors explore causes of finance students' difficulties and suggest strategies for addressing them. The results suggest that the homework tasks typically given them, such as quantitative problem sets using algorithmic procedures, do not prepare them to confront ill-structured problems requiring disciplinary arguments aimed at specified audiences. Research further suggests that teaching audience adaptationespecially for nonexpert audiencesis helpful in promoting critical thinking.

Using instances drawn from their own classrooms, the authors show how students can recognize the value of understanding their role in creating culture each time they choose how to act, how to evaluate others' behavior, and whether to label what is going on as cultural.

However, few scholars have discussed the ethical implications of adjusting r{\'{e}}sum{\'{e}} keywords for the sole purpose of increasing searchbot hits. As the r{\'{e}}sum{\'{e}} genre has evolved over the past century, strategies of r{\'{e}}sum{\'{e}} padding have likewise evolved, at each stage violating one of four maxims of the Cooperative Principle. Direct factual misrepresentation violates the maxim of quality and is of course discouraged, but r{\'{e}}sum{\'{e}} writers have turned in succession to violations of manner (formatting tricks) and then more recently to violations of quantity and/or relevance with deceptive keywording techniques. The authors conclude by suggesting several techniques to business communication instructors that may encourage students to create more ethically sound r{\'{e}}sum{\'{e}}s.

To meet their needs, U.S. professional communication faculty are designing short courses that can be delivered abroad during between-term periods and that foster an understanding of the situations and genres of the field within a context of cultural dislocation. Based on the courses described in this article, the best approach is to settle students in one location rather than touring; keep student numbers low by an entrepreneurial approach to keeping costs low; encourage students to live as the locals do, in apartments rather than hotels; explicitly plan appropriate access to technology; use class time to provide structure and reflection, but allow free time for collateral learning; and make sure the course grows local roots. ","Andrews, Deborah C; Henze, Brent",19,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Andrews, Deborah C","Henze, Brent",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,2,5,20,

Confronted with enormous rhetorical challenges, Merck tried to generate public goodwill toward the company by creating a personalized image of a corporate giant worthy of understanding, sympathy, and trust. Open letters released during the initial response to the VIOXX crisis rely on the intimacy of interpersonal communication and demonstrate to students of business communication arguments based on ethos. The syntax and diction of these documents are analyzed to demonstrate how they create a secondary narrative of Merck's good sense, good moral character, and goodwill. Finally, the study presents apparently contradictory narratives of this pharmaceutical giant's responsibility, narratives that summarize the arguments in the VIOXX litigation. Analysis of Merck's open letters underscores the relevance of many concepts covered in the business communications classroom.

Briefly put, classic PBL inverts the typical instructional sequence; rather than presenting concepts first and then asking students to apply them, PBL creates situations in which students must learn the concepts in order to solve a problem constructed for that purpose. Thus, students learn in an iterative process as they cycle through the three key questions: What do we know? What do we need to know? and How will we learn it? We advocate emphasizing three key elements inherent in classic PBL: rhetoricity, locality, and change. ","Pennell, Michael; Miles, Libby",17,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Pennell, Michael","Miles, Libby",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,4,377,394,

The results of a survey of 238 industry supervisors were collected over a 5-year period in the departments of English and communication at a private university in the Northeast. While the results suggest that student interns tend to meet their supervisors' expectations in many areas, performance categories such as initiative, writing skills, and oral communication skills require increased attention in the ways we prepare students for their internships and post-graduation employment and, perhaps, the ways we help onsite supervisors develop expectations for and evaluate our interns. ","Sapp, David Alan; Zhang, Qin",17,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Sapp, David Alan","Zhang, Qin",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,4,274,288,

An academic service-learning (ASL) component is included. Adopted as a required class for a master of science degree in accounting at two universities, this course supports accounting accreditation. Surveys offer evidence that both accounting practitioners and faculty rate, in slightly different order, the three most important skills as written communication, oral communication, and analytical/critical thinking. Accounting curricula worldwide are under pressure to develop better skills in these areas as well as to meet assessment and accreditation directives and criteria. The authors designed a communication course utilizing ASL that not only meets all of the above objectives but also provides the student with hands-on experiential learning. Information about this course provides a guide to accounting and business faculty who may wish to pursue such an approach in their schools. ","Sharifi, Mohsen; McCombs, Gary B; Fraser, Linda Lussy; McCabe, Robert K",16,33,54,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Sharifi, Mohsen","McCombs, Gary B","Fraser, Linda Lussy","McCabe, Robert K",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,4,177,199,

However, there is a lack of well-grounded empirical data concerning precisely what accountancy employers mean by oral communication and what specific skills they value most highly. This article describes a research project investigating the importance of 27 oral communication skills for students intending to begin an accountancy career in New Zealand, as perceived by chartered accountancy professionals. It also examines how frequently accountancy employers are finding these desired skills in new graduates. The findings reported in this study offer important guidance concerning the oral communication skills that new graduates will find most useful in the New Zealand accountancy workplace and suggest useful directions for accountancy students internationally. ","Gray, F Elizabeth",-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Gray, F Elizabeth",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,3,40,67,

This article discusses how scenes from popular television series such as Everybody Loves Raymond, Friends, and The Mary Tyler Moore Show  can be used to teach effective job interview skills in business communication courses. Television episodes may be used to examine in detail topics commonly covered in textbook discussions of job interviewing, such as attire, behavior, and interview questions; they may also be used to explore topics not typically addressed, such as gender issues and involvement of family members. The use of appropriate television scenes can enhance the job interviewing unit by attracting the students' attention and generating productive class discussion. The article also provides an overview of the relevant U.S. legality issues. ","Bloch, Janel",-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Bloch, Janel",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,2,7,21,

However, results also indicate that the ethical practice of the employer fulfilling the psychological contract (keeping promises) entered into with the teacher offsets this negative spiral with implications for both teacher well-being and workplace outcomes.

These strategies encouraged collaborative peer learning in a large bicultural/multicultural lecture environment and developed learning relationships typically found in a small class context.

We then guide students to identify the narrative themes running through their experiences, and to use those themes to develop personal brand statements, stories that demonstrate their strengths and values in action, and professional development plans. This sequence of assignments allows students to imagine, construct, and articulate a professional identity through narrative.

By 2011, student feedback had compelled the instructor to consider the limits of technological optimism and revise the course. Specifically, Singaporean students have displayed a need to save face online, which has led to a localized teaching approach.

Building on relevant pedagogical theory and practice, the author also makes the claim that personal reflective writing exercises can make students better writers and more effective managers and leaders. The article concludes with sample exercises that readers might try in their own business communication classrooms.

Results indicate employers must show that they value good writing and that writing skills must become the employee's habit. Implications for business communication pedagogy are discussed.

The goal of writing instruction in business communication classes is to develop the skills and knowledge necessary to successfully meet future writing challenges. However, many writers struggle to transfer skills and knowledge from one context to another. The primary reason for this struggle is that despite years of writing instruction, most people are highly apprehensive about writing and do not consider themselves writers. Writing instruction typically does little to lessen writing apprehension, but fostering writing self-efficacy can both diminish writing apprehension and further writing development.

The research analyzed all syllabi of FOB courses offered in the spring 2010 semester for evidence of WAC looking for indications of writing activities. The analysis focused on both expressive/informal and product/formal writing and discovered through the syllabi the intention of the instructor to incorporate writing. The findings suggest that these courses require little or no writing and therefore principles of WAC are not evident. ,"Nicolas, Maureen O'Day; Annous, Samer",23,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Nicolas, Maureen O'Day","Annous, Samer",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,4,172,187,

Using writing exercises as a diagnostic or maintenance tool at different stages in the semester, in addition to the core assignments, can drastically improve undergraduate and graduate student writing and increase the probability that these students will transfer that writing knowledge into other courses and into their practices as professional writers in industry.

To negotiate this complexity of diversity, we describe an initiative to foster collaborative student-led analyses of a case study to open up meaningful discussions around diversity.

As he used the new microblogging channel, some of his previously private communication became public, some personal communication became professional, and some professional communication became personal. The case shows how social media can significantly affect chief executive officers' communication by encouraging boundary crossing. Understanding the connections between the private versus public and personal versus professional rhetorical categories will help business communicators make wise choices as technology continues to introduce new social media and other channel options.

The suggested approach was designed and tested within a project implemented in Austria, the UK, Slovenia and Romania. Evidence from this multi-country study of employers and business graduates suggests that it is possible to investigate industry requirements with a cluster of eight key generic competencies. Competencies were selected following a detailed analysis of academic literature and 39 semi-structured qualitative interviews. A survey was conducted with 900 business graduates and employers in four European countries. The survey confirmed that the eight key competencies selected were both valuable for business graduates' current job performance as well as relevant for future career development. Survey results showed that employers were not very confident in the level of capability of business graduates in the eight competencies investigated in this study.

The primary aim of the research was to investigate the learning experience and perceptions of the students, and to use the findings to evaluate the effectiveness of the course design and delivery system. Action research was used, with longitudinal data collected over a three-year period (20082010). Three survey rounds were conducted focussing on Oman, one of the UK University's main overseas learning collaborating centres. The three rounds yielded 116 valid responses in total. The first survey showed a fairly high level of student satisfaction with the programme but also indicated areas that needed further improvement. The impacts of subsequent changes in the programme were investigated in the second and third surveys. Feedback from these helped develop further changes in the learning content and delivery approach of the programme. The study contributes to a better understanding of global blended learning initiatives, and offers insights to managers on improving course management, enriching learning content, enhancing teaching quality, and improving students' satisfaction levels.","Bentley, Yongmei; Selassie, Habte; Parkin, Elizabeth",17,34,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Bentley, Yongmei","Selassie, Habte","Parkin, Elizabeth",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,3,75,87,

As the future success of the accountancy profession depends on its ability to attract high calibre students it should not overlook the significance of school students in its recruitment drive. A questionnaire requiring respondents to rate the importance of 26 factors, synthesised from research on professional career-choice decisions, was completed by school leavers in Ireland. They consider job satisfaction to be the most important criteria when selecting a career, followed by good working conditions and career aptitude. In contrast, neither their parents' career nor the opportunities to work in their home area are viewed as important. Students intending to pursue an accounting career regard prestige and financial rewards to be more important than those who are not contemplating such a career, while the latter group rank work-life balance, good citizenship and self-fulfilment as more important. The respondents report that their parents and subject teachers are the only people who influence their career decisions with friends, relatives, guest speakers and interestingly, career guidance teachers having no influence.","Byrne, Marann; Willis, Pauline; Burke, John",14,31,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Byrne, Marann","Willis, Pauline","Burke, John",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,4,101,111,

Engagement, realism and handling complexity are important issues in Operations Management teaching, learning and assessment. It is argued that traditional text based case studies do not address these concerns sufficiently and consequently can encourage surface learning approaches. Consultancy and simulation are more likely to be effective on these issues with the greater focus on experiential learning. However the constraints of these techniques restrict use as assessment options, particularly for large undergraduate programmes.  This paper offers tutors of Operations Management an alternative approach to facilitating experiential learning using a multimedia case. The action research reported here develops this multimedia approach, identifies the practical considerations and the potential for improved student learning outcomes. The findings indicate that this multimedia approach was engaging, realistic and challenging hence facilitated greater student interest, understanding and skills.","Jones, Ollie; Kerr, Marie",13,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Jones, Ollie","Kerr, Marie",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,4,186,200,

Previous studies claim that students should have an opportunity to engage themselves with practising researchers and a community of peers, experts, and others. However, earlier research demonstrates disciplinary differences among learning environments and the students' opportunities to engage with the scientific community. This paper draws on the experiences of three small groups of doctoral students in order to illuminate the importance of communities of practice in doctoral education in terms of students' perceived experiences of doctoral study. The study is set in the context of industrial engineering and management. A qualitative methodology was used to explore students' experiences of participating in small groups and ways in which this participation has contributed to their doctoral studies. An inductive protocol was used to analyse the data gathered through thematic interviews (N=10). The findings of this study suggest that communities of practice can have a positive effect on doctoral students' doctoral experience, and therefore support their doctoral studies. The results suggest that some students need help from faculties and departments in order to develop peer connections.","Lahenius, Katja",-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Lahenius, Katja",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,3,29,38,

The proper emotional climate is a complex phenomenon which should involve the right balance of emotions in terms of their valence, intensity, sequence, congruence etc. Adaptation of emotional responses to different situations requires application of contingency approach in creating an optimal emotional climate in the classroom. Invoking Hersey and Blanchard's seminal model of Situational Leadership, this paper provides theoretical background for using certain emotional responses in different situations. Using the contingency paradigm allows for reaching an apt level of theoretical generalization, avoiding one best-way approach on the one hand and addressing emotions on a case-by-case basis on the other.

This simulation requires numerous levels of involvement from students (e.g. planning and analysis, discussion and negotiation, teaching and learning, seeing and touching, feedback and application), and, thus, may provide an enduring lesson to participants. The simulation objectives and debrief points correlate the activities that the students experience during the chess match to specific management principles. As the simulation unfolds students will apply most of these principles, and, during the debrief, students will discover that they had been utilizing management principles in the game, and, thus, had gained experience in the application of these principals.

Significant gender differences were found in overall satisfaction. Moreover, results showed the most important predictors of overall students' satisfaction were intention to leave, trust in management, and perception of readiness for change. In addition to gender, cultural differences may also play a role students experience. Future research may also use a longitudinal approach to eliminate the limitations of a cross-sectional study.

The implicit learning objectives contained in producing research proposals are described and evaluated in terms of learning about research and research methodology. Particular consideration is given to the potential of research proposals to work in an educative sense as stand-alone entities quite separate from their role as a prelude to engaging in research activity. The benefits and limitations of using research proposals in separation from the actual experience of conducting empirical research are discussed. It is concluded that research proposals, used as stand-alone learning exercises, can prove particularly valuable where there might be concerns about gaining access to appropriate settings or getting ethical approval for practical research activity. They can also be of particular value in the context of courses where students' primary concern is with commissioning or evaluating research rather acquiring the skills to undertake research projects for themselves (e.g. MBA students).","Denscombe, Martyn",-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Denscombe, Martyn",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,4,142,149,

Findings indicate that respondents generally felt that e-business is important and should be included in accounting degrees: both to reflect changes in the business environment and to increase the employability of graduates. However, the majority of respondents did not themselves teach any e-business topics to accounting students. While this could be attributed to a combination of factors, the most significant impediment to further emphasis on e-business was reported to be the lack of space in already crowded syllabi. Interestingly, lack of staff expertise or teaching materials were not considered to be major impediments.

A study of 242 business school students shows a significant correlation between implemental entrepreneurial mindsets and the founding of new companies. However, elaborating entrepreneurial mindsets are unrelated to entrepreneurial activities. Further analysis shows that activation of elaborating entrepreneurial mindsets may actually disrupt the positive relationship between implemental entrepreneurial mindset and entrepreneurial activities. A possible explanation for this finding may be the different impacts of these types of mindsets on doubt and decisiveness of the subjects. While implementing mindsets are conducive to action, elaborating mindsets may induce more cognitive activity and doubt, increasing the threshold between intention and action.

We suggest that, as well as influencing the future of their graduates, business schools should be responsible for what type of BSG they produce. Our typology offers four types _ the Replacer, the Effectiveness Increaser, the World Improver and the Reflectionist. We propose that in future business schools should place emphasis on providing a wider education balancing human, environmental and economic perspectives. More credence must be given to the latter two types of BSG as opposed to the first two, who are the favoured choices of today.","Ortenblad, Anders; Koris, Riina; Farquharson, Maris,; Shih-wei, 'Bill' Hsu",18,32,53,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Ortenblad, Anders","Koris, Riina","Farquharson, Maris,","Shih-wei, 'Bill' Hsu",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,3,85,92,

Yet the teaching and learning of this subject is often not smooth particularly for less numerical students. The conventional teaching approach, typified by students passively receiving statistical knowledge taught through the use of made-up data, has been discussed in previous statistics education research, and a number of revised approaches including problem-based learning, experiential learning, graphics and simulation, and understanding of students' previous statistical knowledge, have been put forward, all of which have the overriding aim at improving learning in statistics.  All of these revised approaches have successfully shown the benefits of their focus on the depth of learning. However, these benefits do not come without costs, as most of them sacrifice the breadth of what students should effectively learn. What's more, it is apparent that none of these approaches nurture an environment encouraging students to integrate the statistical concepts they learn.  To achieve improved learning in statistics, this study argues that deep learning constitutes only one facet of learning  breadth and integration being the others. Students should also have the right to learn the whole breadth of statistical knowledge as it was with the conventional teaching approach. They should also be given a learning setting within which they could engage in integrative learning.  This paper concentrates on the pilot trial of a new teaching approach that aims at achieving the triple effects of depth, breadth, and integration in student learning of statistics. It will give an account of the theoretical underpinning, the procedures taken, and the evidence collected for the new approach with the potential to achieve these three effects. As the pilot trial has such an ambitious aim, it is likely there may be some further room to fine tune the new teaching approach. The author does not claim that the new approach introduced in this paper is an optimal solution for teaching statistics. Instead, the new teaching approach, after having achieved a successful pilot trial outcome, should be positioned as an approach showing signs of improvement compared to the existing ones.","Shiu, Eric",-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Shiu, Eric",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,3,12,24,

However, many needs assessment approaches rely on self-report attitudinal measures that are potentially plagued by self-presentation and social desirability biases. An alternative to self-reports are unobtrusive observations of actual behavior that reduce the potential for self-presentation. This paper presents a needs assessment framework describing how the trust game and the dictator game adopted from experimental economics can help measure discrimination, distinguish between stereotypes and prejudice, and determine appropriate diversity training methods accordingly. The purpose of this paper is to show how behavioral measures can complement attitudinal measures in the needs assessment process. The overall recommendation emanating from this paper is that diversity educators in business schools rely less on self-report measures and use more behavioral indicators in their attempts to design more effective diversity courses and programs.","Volk, Stefan",-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Volk, Stefan",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,4,163,173,

To this end, we argue that a shared understanding amongst stakeholders concerning complexity and risk is both urgent and mutually beneficial. Ideally it would lead to collaborative design of curriculum and pedagogy and avoid overly narrow specialisation. We use the notion of holism' to explore the difficulties in comprehending the span of change in contemporary business, presenting holistic risk' as a vital but aspirational construct transcending boundaries, functions and disciplines. Specifically we address implications for teaching and learning holistic risk, for related program goals and curriculum design, and for embedding critical analytical skills into curriculum, arguing that students engage with holistic risk throughout the entire spectrum of problem-solving. Thus, educators must grapple with helping students in this effort. In support, we offer examples of our own practice in curriculum design and pedagogy. We conclude that the concept of holism might provoke a better understanding between educators and industry stakeholders concerning knowledge and skills to deal with risks associated with dynamic shifts in business environments.

Ecological approaches are used at the University of Tasmania to heighten the awareness of students to a raft of difficult to observe environmental factors associated with developing enterprising ideas. At Sheffield University, the discovery and exploitation of entrepreneurial opportunities is viewed as a co-evolving system of emerging business ideas, and routines/heuristics respectively. It is argued that using both approaches enables students to develop a greater awareness of their situated environment, and ultimately the degree of fit between their learning process and a changing external world. The authors argue that in order to improve the chances of longer-term survival what is needed is a new level of organisation where the individual is capable of developing a representation of the external world that he or she can use to sense the appropriateness of local decisions. This reinterpretation of events allows individuals to step back and examine the broader consequences of their actions through the interpretation and anticipation of feedback from the environment. These approaches thus seek to develop practice-based heuristics which individuals can use to make sense of their lived experiences, as they learn to evolve in an increasingly complex world.","Breslin, Dermot; Jones, Colin",16,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Breslin, Dermot","Jones, Colin",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,4,433,444,

This question was investigated using data gathered in three focus groups involving T{\&}L specialists, strategic management and HRM academics, and HRM practitioners. Through a process of successive focussing, potential T{\&}L strategies were initially identified and then tested and refined in the focus groups. Drawing on input from the participants and the literature, we make the case that SHRM can be effectively taught through a combination of primarily case-based and problem-based approaches. We also illustrate how process worksheets can be employed to provide problem solving support to students when they carry out complex learning tasks based on authentic SHRM problems.

This is due to a gap in our theoretical understanding of what it takes to become entrepreneurial. Research suggests that beyond acquiring knowledge and skill to act entrepreneurially, entrepreneurial learning also involves the development of an entrepreneurial identity. Yet most accounts of entrepreneurship education do not include this concept. We explore entrepreneurial identity and how it is constructed within an entrepreneurship education. Connecting entrepreneurial learning theory with literature on identity, we developed a set of categories addressing the construction of an entrepreneurial identity. In a case study at a European technical university, we used these categories to sample and analyze narrative data developed as students created new ventures. The results support our supposition that, in the context of a new venture creation program, students experience challenges that lead to the development of entrepreneurial identity. Based on these findings, we argue that, if the educational objective is learning for the practice of entrepreneurship, then identity construction needs to be seen as important a goal as the development of knowledge and skill.","Donnellon, Anne; Ollila, Susanne; Williams Middleton, Karen",16,33,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Donnellon, Anne","Ollila, Susanne","Williams Middleton, Karen",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,4,490,499,

Semi-structured interviews are used to obtain data from a sample of 30 business degree students at a UK university. The findings confirm previous studies, that financial necessity is a primary driver of part-time work, but also reveal a complex set of supplementary reasons, that either satisfies a long-term vision, or a more immediate need for development or self-gratification. Furthermore, most students compromise the longer-term benefit of study against the more immediate financial gains offered by work, resulting in an accepted lowering of academic performance as a consequence. The majority of the students did not see a connecting opportunity between their part-time work and future career, and were uncertain regarding future career direction. This study extends the use of qualitative methods in this area, which is dominated by survey research, while also extending extant findings to the career aspirations of students, which is hitherto largely unexplored.","Evans, Carl; Gbadamosi, Gbolahan; Richardson, Mark",12,33,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Evans, Carl","Gbadamosi, Gbolahan","Richardson, Mark",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,3,80,90,

This paper also aims to challenge the current approach of assessing educational performance by cross-sectional analysis, a widespread short-term instrument for assessing multi-variable behavior among different entities at a same moment. In contrast with a cross-sectional approach, our research has adopted the time-series analysis, a long-term methodology that can generate econometric coefficients and parameters from a cause-effect investigation, which is more appropriate for the purpose of drawing up projections and forecasts. Because our analysis extends over time, we develop, by the end of the study, an Abacus for Education based on cause-effect relationships derived from time series, the use of which will assist in understanding the future impact of educational policies, and therefore lead to the development of better policies. This paper makes two important contributions: it provides empirical evidence on the effects of public expenditure on educational effectiveness and it also sheds light on methodological issues by indicating that endogenous and exogenous variables can help in predicting values for public education outcomes.","Fabrino, Ricardo Jos{\'{e}} Grossi; Siqueira do Valle, Bruno; Gomes, Ricardo Correa",35,61,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Fabrino, Ricardo Jos{\'{e}} Grossi","Siqueira do Valle, Bruno","Gomes, Ricardo Correa",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,4,151,166,

Moreover, very little research has been conducted regarding the question whether socio-economic background has an impact on effectiveness of entrepreneurship programs in general and in schools in particular. In this paper we focused not only on the general efficacy of teaching entrepreneurship to adolescents, but we also examined if socio-economic status has a moderating effect on this process. Longitudinal data were gathered from 19 schools located in different socio-economic environments in the center of Israel, sampling 630 matched pairs of students half of which participated in the Doing Business program operated by Junior Achievement Israel, and the other half that functioned as a control group. Findings showed that when controlling for socio-economic school environments, the program was very effective for pupils in schools located in middle and high socio-economic environments. For pupils from low socio-economic environments, on the other hand, the program seemed to change their entrepreneurial attitudes in the wrong direction. In terms of self-efficacy, perceived feasibility and perceived desirability, participating pupils actually ranked lower after having taken part in the program. Thus, the data show that while the program is very effective for middle and upper class adolescents, encouraging them to become more entrepreneurial, it is detrimental to pupils from lower socio-economic environments, which value themselves with less self-efficacy and see entrepreneurship as less feasible and desirable when they finish the program. Moreover, even their business knowledge does not seem to have improved significantly. We recommend creating entrepreneurial education programs that are geared specifically to the needs of pupils from lower socio-economic environments.","Heilbrunn, Sibylle; Almor, Tamar",19,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Heilbrunn, Sibylle","Almor, Tamar",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,4,445,455,

Accordingly, oral communication dominates assurance of learning standards and is frequently cited as one of the most desired graduate employability skills. Previous research, typically focused on employer perceptions, largely indicates graduate oral communication skills do not meet industry expectations. This study investigates how 674 recent business graduates perceived their own capabilities in oral communication skills, noting variations by background/demographic characteristics. Overall, business graduates rated their capabilities in oral communication highly although mean ratings for the 14 sub-behaviours varied. Certain sub-behaviours varied with graduate age and time spent working since graduation. Findings suggest a disparity between graduate and employer perceptions on the standard of oral communication skills upon graduation. Participants also considered the effectiveness of different learning activities for developing oral communication skills during their undergraduate studies. Popular learning activities were individual/group presentations and small group projects. The number of activity types engaged in during degree studies did not significantly impact perceived capabilities and only peer feedback, individual and group presentations caused significant variations in certain sub-behaviours. Despite graduates reporting opportunities for a wide range of learning activities, these are not always effective. Strategies for education and professional practitioners for enhancing graduate oral communication skill outcomes are discussed.","Jackson, Denise",-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Jackson, Denise",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,3,22,34,

As well as integrating professional ethics into their curriculum, Business Schools are also developing standalone ethics courses, showing that they take seriously their responsibility to help prepare the next generation of managers to improve business' track record of transparency, accountability and sustainable development. However what are the learning approaches that will help to bring about real improvements in business ethics learning at university? This paper argues that a holistic approach to ethics teaching is needed, in which students are encouraged to develop ethical knowledge and skills within their personal value systems. In this way ethics does not become something apart but integrated into one's terms of reference. The paper discusses a particular pedagogic approach designed to develop a student's critical consciousness' using a student-led learning method in which students actively engage with important concepts and discuss the issues amongst themselves within an environment where they can speak freely. Qualitative interviews with a selection of undergraduates on the compulsory first year professional ethics module provide insight into the impact of the method on attitudes and behaviours.","Jagger, Suzy; Volkman, Richard",13,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Jagger, Suzy","Volkman, Richard",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,4,177,185,

In addition to these factors, a supplementary dimension is suggested  the holistic person perspective  in order to offer a measurement approach beyond the borders of a single course or program. From a case study of social entrepreneurship at the Humanities in Denmark, it is described how students develop entrepreneurial experiences both in courses, between courses and in their daily life.

Analysis of the data suggests that most students do seem to develop a sense of belonging by week 7 of semester one, but a significant minority (1015{\%}) of students in each institution do not. This report concludes that these students are more likely to have some issues settling in and feeling that they are accepted in the university environment. Unfortunately, experiencing a lack of social integration is a factor that encourages students to leave education. These students may require support if they are to gain a strong sense of belonging to their institution.

Three kinds of emotional events strongly linked to developed entrepreneurial competencies were interaction with outside world, uncertainty and ambiguity and team-work experience. These emotional events were linked to formation of entrepreneurial identity, increased self-efficacy, increased uncertainty and ambiguity tolerance and increased self-insight. These links represent early empirical evidence for three effective design principles of entrepreneurial education, and can also be used as indirect measures in assessment.

From these interviews four attitudinal issues were extracted  how comfortable students are with an assessment mode, how important they find the mode, fairness of the assessment mode, and how useful they find the mode. A survey was then distributed to final year marketing students and their perceptions of these issues were assessed. These results were subsequently presented to separate focus groups for their insights into the survey outcomes. The principal findings of the study are that there are cultural barriers to fair and consistent formal peer assessment of group work involving heterogeneous populations, particularly pertaining to collectivist/individualist backgrounds as exemplified in this study.","McLeay, Fraser; Wesson, David",15,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"McLeay, Fraser","Wesson, David",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,4,142,150,

The research is centred on creating innovative assessments during the key transition year focussing on creating Assessment for Confidence. This aims to eliminate barriers to success, improve student engagement with their Community Of Practice and therefore increase student retention. This study consisted of longitudinal practitioner action research over four years within the University of Cumbria Business School identifying students' perceptions of their barriers to learning. The research identified study skills, academic language, socialisation and traditional formal assessment as the main barriers to student achievement. Key conclusions were that early low-stakes assessment designed for improving confidence was an excellent vehicle for increasing student engagement and retention.","Meer, Nicky M; Chapman, Amanda",14,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Meer, Nicky M","Chapman, Amanda",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,4,186,192,

The findings indicate that an MBA contributes considerably to most of the managerial skills, although relevant criticisms regarding a gap between MBA programs and business needs are not groundless. The MBA also helps graduates to find enriched jobs with increasing compensation over time. On the other hand, it exerts moderate to negligible influence on the selection/hiring process, job hopping and promotions. Contrasting the 2006 survey with the current one, it is found that an MBA degree tends to enhance graduates' careers in both economic boom and decline periods.","Mihail, Dimitrios M; Kloutsiniotis, Panagiotis V",20,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Mihail, Dimitrios M","Kloutsiniotis, Panagiotis V",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,4,212,222,

The influence of education for entrepreneurship and education through entrepreneurship on pupils' level of school engagement and entrepreneurial intentions is analysed and assessed. The paper builds on and extends research about entrepreneurship education for pupils at the lower secondary and upper secondary levels of education (Johannisson, 2010; Pepin, 2012; Peterman {\&} Kennedy, 2003; Surlemont, 2007) by including theories about cognitive and non-cognitive skill formation (Bowles {\&} Gintis, 1976, 2002; Cunha {\&} Heckman, 2007, 2008, 2010), school engagement (Fredricks, Blumenfeld, {\&} Paris, 2004; Libbey, 2004), and purposeful learning (Illeris, 2009; Newmann, 1991; Wentzel {\&} Brophy, 2013) in the theoretical framework. It is found that education for entrepreneurship, which focuses on content and cognitive entrepreneurial skills, has a positive influence on pupils' entrepreneurial intentions but a negative influence on their level of school engagement. The opposite is true for education through entrepreneurship, which has a more pedagogical orientation and focuses on fostering non-cognitive entrepreneurial skills. Furthermore, the role of supportive teaching styles and action-based teaching methods in entrepreneurship education at this level of education is investigated. The analysis is based on data from two surveys including 801 randomly selected Danish ninth-graders (aged 1415) and 576 randomly selected Danish tenth-graders (aged 1516). The findings have implications for policy makers and curriculum designers, inasmuch as the influence of two educational approaches is assessed and analysed, but also for the academic community since it presents an alternative way to assess educational dimensions (content and teaching methods) separately.","Moberg, K{\aa}re",-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Moberg, K{\aa}re",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,4,512,528,

It surveys the contemporary theories of adult learning applied to entrepreneurship education, and then presents the theory of expansive learning within a Cultural Historical Activity Theory framework. The Change Laboratory, a kind of formative intervention developed within this framework and aiming to trigger expansive learning, seeks to redefine work practises through participation and dialectics among the stakeholders within the organization or at the boundaries of intersecting organizations. This model is applied to entrepreneurship education. In Italy and Australia small groups of vocational students undertaking long periods of work experience took part in Change Laboratory workshops. During the workshops the students, together with the researcher, their work tutors and teachers discussed the problems students were having at the boundary between school and work. They found shared solutions and put them into practice. In this process the students displayed entrepreneurial behaviour. The article analyzes the triggering events and the banners made during the workshops by the students in Italy and Australia as proof of expansive learning, as well reflective and transformative learning processes at the boundary.","Morselli, Daniele; Costa, Massimiliano; Margiotta, Umberto",18,39,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Morselli, Daniele","Costa, Massimiliano","Margiotta, Umberto",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,4,333,348,

We wonder how is it possible for students, lacking much professional experience, to construct' useful entrepreneurial knowledge? We address this question by analysing the learning experiences of 54 students and 19 lecturers in different European Entrepreneurship education programs. The study explores the nature and processes of entrepreneurial learning in the university context. It provides understanding of how learners  across cultures and educational backgrounds  engage in the learning process. We identify three personal qualities, which constitute this process: a multi-dimensional sense of responsibility, independent ways of thinking, and the ability to connect to ones own and other peoples' needs. We identified the particular dynamics in which these qualities interact and develop and conclude with suggestions on how education may stimulate this process.","Mueller, Sabine; Anderson, Alistair R",16,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Mueller, Sabine","Anderson, Alistair R",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,4,500,511,

As such it is an ideal method to both study the practices that entrepreneurship educators engage in and the discursive and cognitive shifts that learners go through as they seek a more entrepreneurial understanding. The paper suggests that the flexibility and rigorous nature of ethnography provides an appropriate tool for evaluating entrepreneurship teaching in educational institutions. Entrepreneurship is a practice that has always been of significance to economic development and is increasingly playing an important part in many aspects of 21st century life. While the discourses that surround entrepreneurship have been widely contested they have nevertheless seduced many nation states into searching for new ways to encourage and sustain economic growth. These discourses are evident in policies that use rhetoric about creating more entrepreneurs through explicitly encouraging entrepreneurial behavior by teaching entrepreneurship to students at all levels of education. The introduction of entrepreneurship education into Higher Education discourses can be traced throughout the western world over the last two decades. Whether talking about starting businesses, often the focus for American universities, or encouraging enterprising behavior, the terms used in the UK and some parts of Europe, entrepreneurship education has, using models from cognitive psychology and social cognition theories from education gradually become established as a discipline in Higher Education. As educational anthropologists we are interested in exploring the parameters of this new discipline. We propose that the nature of this discipline lends itself to ethnography as a method for discussions about how enterprising behavior is nurtured, supported and evolves into entrepreneurial practices through socially constructed communities. A close look at the practices of entrepreneurship educators in a Danish Higher Education institute stimulated an analysis of what these teachers do and say they are doing in the entrepreneurship classroom.","Robinson, Sarah; Shumar, Wesley",16,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Robinson, Sarah","Shumar, Wesley",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,4,422,432,

Recognising further the relatively limited amount of studies within a HRM teaching context, we seek to contribute to the SDL literature by outlining the problems that can occur when there are hidden objectives behind the use of SDL.

This paper argues that an alternative approach, based upon embedding transferable skills into the curriculum, produces more consistent and sustainable results than policy led enterprise programme initiatives, especially when informed by a systematic and integrated transferable skills framework. This paper analyses the provision and nature of the transferable skills associated with four, highly successful, enterprise programmes. Using content analysis and a thematic coding system, existing programme documents are analysed to generate a service based framework of transferable skills that can be embedded across institutions. The findings suggest that resource sensitive initiatives are problematic with regard to maintaining sustainable learning programmes and that an embedded transferable skills approach offers greater consistency. We conclude with a framework of transferable skills informed by empirical research, designed to embed such skills across the curriculum, thus shaping the 21st century graduate. The service based framework is an institutional tool for programmes and curriculum design beyond the business school and offers an alternative approach to embedding enterprise education.","Smith, Anne M J; Paton, Robert A",16,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Smith, Anne M J","Paton, Robert A",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,4,550,560,

Previous research has found that simulations are an effective way for students to engage actively in learning, bridging the gap between theory and practice. It has also been found that such simulations can develop students' critical thinking skills. However, hitherto no research has been undertaken into the role that existing critical thinking disposition has on the learning of students, as measured by the degree to which students perceived that they met the module's intended learning outcomes. This research offers insights into the role and importance of critical thinking disposition and its component dimensions and how this impacts student learning. The results indicate that the level of critical thinking disposition is positively related to the students' learning. The implications of the research suggest educators should target business simulations at specific cohorts of students. The relative importance of the critical thinking disposition constructs and the practical educational implications of these findings are discussed.","Bell, Robin; Loon, Mark",12,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Bell, Robin","Loon, Mark",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,4,119,127,

This paper addresses the gap in educational technology literature on the examination of instructor characteristics. We shift the focus from student outcomes to instructor input, pedagogy and their strategy of technology selection. In particular, we explore instructors' approaches to blended learning, pedagogical aims and instructional design. Our study of management academics at two UK business schools reveals that blended learning adoption varies greatly. Based on forty semi-structured interviews with management academics, we find that this adoption depends on personal predispositions of academics towards educational technology. Personal understanding and interpretations of the blended learning phenomenon cluster into four distinct groups: traditionalist, pedagogy-centric, techno-centric and cautious, and instructional design and delivery preferences vary widely between groups. The findings of this study demonstrate that there is a wide variation in instructor approaches to blended management learning and that manifests itself markedly in the pedagogical strategies and instructional design and delivery of management education.","Benson, Vladlena; Kolsaker, Ailsa",17,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Benson, Vladlena","Kolsaker, Ailsa",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,4,316,325,

Dialogue is a practice grounded in a pluralist framework that acknowledges the differing and sometimes conflicting opinions that arise among people with diverse backgrounds and experiences and provides tools to develop an awareness and understanding of these differences. It differs from other classroom practices such as discussion or debate because, unlike those practices, the purpose of dialogue is not to convince or win but to gain deeper understandings of each other. We describe the practice of dialogue as it occurs within a particular context that is created by both structure (for example, how chairs are arranged) and process (for example, how the interactions among seminar participants are conducted). Teaching a course using dialogue goes beyond simple technique to questioning the assumptions that underlie many studentfaculty relationships. We reflect on the challenges inherent in introducing a new way of engaging among faculty and students.","Bigelow, Barbara; Elsass, Priscilla; Arndt, Margarete",17,36,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Bigelow, Barbara","Elsass, Priscilla","Arndt, Margarete",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,3,48,56,

As more methods become available to engage students in experiential learning, examining the impacts of these methodologies becomes even more important. The authors sought to expand the literature by examining how various instructional methodologies may be associated with student learning in a business capstone course. This study examines the relationship between simulation and case instructional methodologies with a rarely-used outcome in the related literature, a standardized assessment of all disciplines related to the business field. Data were collected on demographics, academic performance, and instructional methodology for 1049 undergraduate students from 83 sections of the capstone strategy course from Fall 2006 to Summer 2013. The results show that the instructional methodology utilized in the course was related to scores on the standardized assessment, with the case methodology being associated with higher scores. Computer simulations were not associated with scores significantly different from sections with no experiential exercise. The implications of these findings are discussed, along with potential methods for educators using these methodologies and avenues for future research.","Blackford, Benjamin; Shi, Tiebing",20,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Blackford, Benjamin","Shi, Tiebing",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,3,84,94,

Although theory about the effectiveness of problem-based learning and practical advice about implementing problem-based learning abound, the empirical evidence available to date suggests problem-based learning primarily impacts problem solving and critical thinking skill but not necessarily knowledge acquisition. This paper presents an overview of the prevailing theoretical approach to problem-based learning. Then presents a comprehensive review of the empirical literature on problem-based learning with a focus on its application to the management classroom. Finally, the paper presents an alternative, novel pedagogical theory, Montessorian theory, as applied to problem-based learning, that aligns theory and prevailing research better than the existing theoretical conception. Montessorian theory as applied to problem-based learning can lead to a better understanding of the effectiveness of problem-based learning, focus on more appropriate learning objectives and learning outcomes, and have implications for future research, curricular development, and assessment of learning outcomes in the management classroom.","Carriger, Michael S.",-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Carriger, Michael S.",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,4,249,259,

This exploratory case study aims to contribute to a graduate-centred understanding of work-readiness. A qualitative methodology was used to map students' perceptions and evaluations of their skill development in criteria referenced graduate capabilities and construct a representation of skill development in graduate capabilities from entry to exit. The more problematic areas of skill development and competence in graduate capabilities were in the higher order skills of inquiry/research, creativity and problem solving and collaborative teamwork. Student respondents appeared to have most difficulty in relating the relevance of inquiry/research to work contexts. This study illustrates the need for university educators and curriculum designers to proactively intervene and develop effective learning activities for individual learners and to regularly monitor and review progression towards desired employability skills from entry to exit. Graduates risk criticism from employers if they leave university with underdeveloped skills on exit from university and for the purpose of transference to employability skills.","Cavanagh, Jillian; Burston, Mary; Southcombe, Amie; Bartram, Tim",18,33,51,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Cavanagh, Jillian","Burston, Mary","Southcombe, Amie","Bartram, Tim",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,4,278,288,

To connect these practices to the outcomes of satisfaction and confidence, we examined student responses to a newly designed, experiential undergraduate business curriculum. The results indicated that, compared to students who graduated from a traditional, functionally structured curriculum, students graduating from the holistic, experiential curriculum were significantly higher in their satisfaction and career self-efficacy (but not leader self-efficacy).

Cowan (1998) postulates that students should go through a process of reflecting for, in and on action. Through the use of Participatory Action Research (PAR) the researchers developed and propose educational initiatives that can be employed to encourage student reflection and can be categorised according to Cowan's (1998) model. Additionally, the researchers propose a model of integrative reflection, where reflection is less sequential and reflection for, in and on action overlap.

The aim of this exploratory case study is to investigate the perceptions of undergraduate accounting students using Twitter as a learning support tool. The literature suggests the use of Twitter supports a range of communication functions as well as pedagogic functions. Although there have been few studies, the educational literature is generally positive about the use of Twitter, whereas there is an emerging non-educational literature about the operational aspects of Twitter which provides evidence of potential limitations in its educational use. This study provided students with a range of experiences using Twitter as a learning support tool. The students involved offered a range of perceptions about its value in supporting accounting education. Overall, this exploratory study demonstrates the relatively complex perceptions of accounting students about using Twitter. It is concluded that while Twitter has some communication and pedagogic potential, educators should plan its use carefully in the context of its limitations and operating dynamics. As a result educators should expect some unpredictability in students' motivation and varying support for its use.","Osgerby, Julia; Rush, David",15,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Osgerby, Julia","Rush, David",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,4,337,348,

It has also noted that the reciprocal relationship between research and teaching in management has been inadequately studied. This paper addresses this research inadequacy. It briefly outlines that OB courses are unfavorably viewed in the business education and that there is inadequate transmission of research knowledge in teaching. It discusses the need for transmitting OB research-based knowledge in teaching and outlines some of the suggestions contained in the existing research for facilitating such transmission. In light of these suggestions contained in the literature, it describes an actual example that illustrates how OB research-teaching link can be strengthened through two complementary processes of research-based teaching and teaching-inspired research. The example outlined in the paper is in the form of an illustration. The specific and concrete example serves to illuminate and illustrate the generalized issue of research-teaching link. The example illustrates one way of addressing the generalized issue of enhancing the research-teaching link. The example also illustrates how the generalized research-teaching-research cycle can operate iteratively to enhance the research-teaching link.","Pawar, Badrinarayan Shankar",-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Pawar, Badrinarayan Shankar",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,4,326,336,

As a reflection of this, the research-teaching gap also has been noted in the literature. Possibly as a consequence of this, concerns have been expressed about inadequate transmission of OB knowledge body through OB teaching and about the impaired legitimacy of behavioral coursework in the business education. These concerns in the existing literature suggest a need for examining the nature of OB knowledge body and for exploring the issues it may create for OB teaching. The present paper addresses this research requirement. It first points out the need to examine OB knowledge features and the resulting issues in OB teaching. It then explains why the nature of OB knowledge is likely to affect OB teaching and create issues in OB teaching. It then describes some limiting features of the specific elements concepts, theories, and empirical findings-in OB knowledge body. In light of the limiting features of the OB knowledge discussed, it then explores some of the resulting issues in OB teaching.

Entrepreneurship can be fostered by inculcating entrepreneurial skills right at the stage of education. The presence of Entrepreneurship Development Cell (EDC) in educational institutes helps in developing entrepreneurial culture in academic institutions so as to foster growth of innovation and entrepreneurship. With this premise a study was conducted on 1254 students of government and private institutes pursuing post graduation in Commerce, Science and Humanities with/without exposure to EDC in the national capital region of India. The results of the present study show that the students exposed to the activities of EDC are significantly higher on Innovation as compared to the students who do not get any such exposure.

How participants will make decisions in the simulation is a function of both the participant's expertise and their interaction with the exercise design. It is an important pedagogical issue to know whether the design of the simulation reinforces and builds a participant's ability to respond in a normative reasoned fashion to a decision situation, or to experience the situation in its complexity and respond in a synthetic intuitive fashion. To comprehend the implications of these two viewpoints I present the debate between promoters of the normative views and the descriptive views on decision-making. By performing a critical analysis of these different perspectives, I offer insight on how the decision-making philosophy used in the design of simulations affects both the use of the simulation and the measurable learning outcomes.","Scherpereel, Christopher M.",-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Scherpereel, Christopher M.",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,4,381,389,

Criticisms of ME, we argue, are founded on the irrelevancy' debate, which is conceptualised in the first half of our literature review. The second half of the literature review examines Association of Business Schools (ABS) reports and reviews how business schools are responding to these critiques, reliant primarily on the tried and tested experiential learning models to do so. Building on these, Practice Weeks' are then presented as a case example from the University of Bedfordshire Business School (UBBS) as an innovative response to surfaced criticisms. Data is drawn from interviews carried out with students and employers who have participated in UBBS Practice Weeks, supported by quantitative insights from student survey questionnaires. Findings evidence that Practice Weeks have the potential to go further than existing experiential learning models to deliver practice-based education to business school students, whilst also capturing an effective and efficient approach to supporting business and community organisations in meeting their objectives.","Sheppard, Emily; Minocha, Sonal; Hristov, Dean",16,32,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Sheppard, Emily","Minocha, Sonal","Hristov, Dean",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,4,106,117,

Drawing upon the literature into authentic assessment  a body of work that provides evidence-based principles to enhance assessment practice and outcomes  this paper attempts to provide a foundation for research in this area. From the 35 surveys and 8 interviews conducted with educators who use business-related simulations, it is apparent that the majority are applying creative assessment practices and that most follow authentic assessment principles  whether they use this terminology or not  including offering students developmental (formative) assessment opportunities over the course of the simulation, explaining assessment criteria and ways that students can improve their performance, requiring students to undertake reflection on their learning and outcomes, and ensuring that higher order thinking skills are engaged. Findings also show considerable similarities in where students are performing less well and in tutor perceptions of the reasons why. The research provides ideas for simulation educators to develop their assessment as well as a basis for future research into simulation assessment and ways to improve student outcomes.","Vos, Lynn",-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Vos, Lynn",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,3,57,74,

Further, the type of plasticity change enables (or disables) or favors (or discourages) different thinking capabilities. Applying these findings, the authors offer an argument that the type of change enabled by teaching-to-repeat (T2R), a passive learning approach prevalent in business education, prepares students' brains to perform in a manner quite different from that valued by business practitioners. Of perhaps greater importance, educational methods of this sort actively discourage the type of brain development consistent with desired capabilities. The authors propose pedagogy  teaching-to-vary (T2V), consistent with development of a different type of plasticity. They argue that by implementing techniques designed to foster variation, working against the brain's tendency toward a preference for the familiar, business educators can both mitigate T2R effects, and better prepare students' brains to manage in uncertain, often turbulent environments.

We find that, after controlling for student demographics and other characteristics, intensive courses do result in higher grades than traditional 16 week semester length courses and that this benefit peaks at about 4 weeks. By looking at future performance we are also able to show that the higher grades reflect a real increase in knowledge and are not the result of a lowering of the bar during summer. We discuss some of the policy implications of our findings.","Austin, Adrian M; Gustafson, Leland",17,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Austin, Adrian M","Gustafson, Leland",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,3,26,37,

This study presents the hypothesis that greater numbers of such initiatives and/or referenda may increase voter turnout because they may elevate the expected gross (and hence net) benefits of voting by empowering voters, despite any accompanying information costs that may tend to elevate the expected gross costs of voting. The empirical evidence to address the net overall effect of these forms of direct democracy on voter turnout is provided.","Cebula, Richard J; Lawson, Luther D",18,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Cebula, Richard J","Lawson, Luther D",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,3,26,32,

There is a much more significant positive relationship between grades received in two prerequisite mathematics courses and the grade in the introductory finance course. The letter grade received in the prerequisite microeconomics course reveals the phenomenon of persistence in that the probability of obtaining a good grade in the finance course is greater if the student received an A or B in the microeconomics course. Final grades earned in prerequisite accounting courses also influence final grades in the introductory finance class.

In early 2013 it is possible to construct a predicted yield curve based on future expectations, and compare it to the actual yield curve. Due to the unconventional Federal Reserve policies that began in 2008, the actual yield curve lies well below that predicted by the term structure theory. Our research indicates that the cumulative impact as of January 2013 of the unconventional Fed monetary policies is to decrease the 10-year Treasury yield by about 80 basis points.","Laignelet, Palomino; Jose, Francisco",20,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Laignelet, Palomino","Jose, Francisco",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,2,1,127,

Simple verbal repetition seems to help cement this difference. In classroom experiments, students who stood and recited the concept aloud performed better on a subsequent exam question than other students. Moreover, the difference persisted onto the final exam even after controlling for differences in student ability and exam preparation. While other active-learning methods might produce similar results, verbalization requires almost no time or instructor effort. It takes only a few seconds and there is nothing to read or grade.

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD _ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.","Fallis, A.G",-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Fallis, A.G",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,2,1,92,

The amount invested in the status good determines each student's relative standing in the classroom. The utility of each student depends both on relative standing and absolute consumption of the non-positional good. The theoretical setting and the experiment illustrate how an increased income may not necessarily increase utility and well-being of consumers in the presence of positional goods and catching up with the Joneses concerns.,"Huber, Joel",-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Huber, Joel",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,4,202,216,

Every word, every syllable, counts, resulting in the reader being drawn quickly and intensely into the poet's unique experience. While legal analysis surely differs from haiku, in both its form and its substance, students and in structors of business law would do well to consider the haiku when striving toward good legal writing. Like other poetic verse, the haiku's bounded form serves to dramatize the poem's content. Similarly, the use of a re- strictive format can supply a tool for beginning legal writers to tighten their writing, and, in the process, to make it more overtly logical and persuasive.","Olazabal, Ann Morales",-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Olazabal, Ann Morales",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,#N/A,0,-x-,

In a student-centered learning environment, the instructor ideally serves primarily as a learning resource or facilitator. With the guidance of the instructor, students in active learning environments strive for higher-level cognitive skills that effectively develop written and oral communication abilities and critical thinking and reasoning skills. Faculty members who wish to incorporate active learning strategies into their law courses must be mindful of the diverse learning styles found in the classroom. Instructors must employ pedagogical methods that reach out to a broad range of learning styles in their efforts to promote student-centered learning and upper-level cognitive skills. Collaborative learning groups integrated with productive technological tools can further strengthen student-centered learning and bridge the gap between different learning styles. A major obstacle to legal studies faculty seeking to achieve these varied learning goals in an undergraduate law course may be the lack of appropriate classroom materials. This article summarizes the major learning domains and reviews higher-level cognitive skills under Bloom's Taxonomy in a legal education context. The importance of active learning and the various types of learning styles found in undergraduate law classes are also addressed. The article then provides the materials for an online dispute resolution (ODR) simulation, ""The Case of the Unhappy Sports Fan,"" and a student reflection paper for a team evaluation of the simulation exercise. These exercises offer student-centered learning opportunities aimed at enhancing upper-level cognitive skills and attuned to different student learning styles. The assignment materials allow for collaborative work outside of class and lead to interesting class discussions about the online learning experience during class time. Two different undergraduate law courses, Cyberlaw and Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) in Business, have successfully used the online simulation and reflection paper, which could be easily replicated in other undergraduate law courses.","Ponte, Lucille M",-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Ponte, Lucille M",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,4,169,194,

Students researching on the Internet do not have to take handwritten or typewritten notes. They can simply print out or copy and save whatever they find. They are even spared the tedium of having to retype the material that they have accessed; today's students can simply copy and paste the material into their assignments. Also, a number of companies, easily accessed online, provide finished research papers for students on business and law-related topics for a fee, which, if utilized, can substitute for doing any work at all. As a result, the age-old problem of plagiarism is exacerbated by the ease and availability of the copying. This article first reviews the importance of helping legal studies students improve their written communication through written assignments, despite the problem of plagiarism. The article argues that students need more education about plagiarism. It looks at definitions of plagiarism and considers typical problems legal studies students may have with plagiarism. The article then suggests faculty strategies for structuring assignments to avoid plagiarism in student assignments.

Cheating is rampant on college campuses. Following a review of the state of academic integrity at colleges and universities, this article then explores the reasons for rising dishonesty on campuses. Using microeconomic analysis of academic dishonesty, including discussion of the externalities that drive college students to cheat, the article provides new insights into deterrence and prevention. Using their Arizona State University (ASU) experience vis-a-vis academic honesty, and in combination with economic theory, the authors present a means for curbing or at least motivating attitudinal changes toward cheating in both the current culture and higher education. They present their microeconomic analysis on cheating and provide data on current student views, as reflected in the responses by over a thousand ASU undergraduates, with regard to academic dishonesty. Then, the authors provide a discussion of the six resolutions proposed by the Student-Faculty Policy Committee and passed by the ASU Faculty Senate in spring 2005. The article concludes with a discussion of the nature of cheating today as compared to the past, and offers insights into what the future may hold in terms of both academic dishonesty and institutional responses.

In-class simulations can serve to develop the all-important critical thinking skills that educated people are expected to possess in today's complex legal environment. Moot court exercises, also known as appellate argumentation or appellate simulation, can be just as effective as mock trials and simulated hearings in teaching skills to students. Law schools, many of which utilize a moot court as part of their regular curriculum, find that it provides students with the opportunity to sharpen their writing skills, to polish their oral presentation skills, and to help them think more carefully about the interplay between factual contexts and legal principles. A moot court, like a mock trial, also ""brings excitement into the classroom and stimulates interest in and appreciation for America's system of justice."" In this article, the author discusses the importance of using appellate simulations in a business law course. He also identifies some obstacles to conducting a realistic and meaningful appellate simulation in a business school setting and describes ways on how to overcome these obstacles.

The author begins this article with a survey of the needs of prelaw majors. Next, she describes her philosophy and teaching methods. She outlines content of ""Law and Lawyers"" and how it is designed to meet needs of students, whether or not they eventually go to law school.

Current concepts in undergraduate business education, such as ethics and sustainability, must also be included in one's classrooms. Some texts highlight issues with landmark cases or feature articles about businesses that have experienced high-profile legal and/or ethical dilemmas. Using high-profile cases and newsworthy business situations are useful in stimulating discussions. However, professors often struggle with keeping students engaged while in the classroom. Real-world examples in the classroom have the best pedagogical value because of their appeal to traditional college students. This article features TerraCycle, Inc., a business that can portray many of the legal principles taught in a Legal Environment of Business course, and this business is interesting to students. This business and its actual litigation with a competitor, coupled with hypothetical legal issues faced by typical businesses, can be used as a basis for discussion for the entire semester to illustrate many of the principles of a typical Legal Environment of Business course. Although this semester-long case study focused on this particular start-up business, any business of interest to students can be used. The authors discuss how to connect TerraCycle, Inc. to students and how it can be utilized for lessons in the classroom.

Defining Teaching Presence in the Online Classroom through Building a Learning Community,2011,28,1,67--116,,,,"In the online environment, students and instructors are virtually, but not physically, present in the same environment. In the online environment, technology mediates learning: it mediates communications and information transfer between the student and the instructor, between the student and the content, and among the students. Critics fear that the lack of face-to-face, personal contact with the instructor and other students creates a remoteness that inhibits learning. The purpose of this article is to describe and analyze two online legal environment courses to determine whether the instructor successfully used technology to create an effective online teaching and learning environment. The central focus is on the concept of ""teaching presence"" in physical and online environments and how teaching presence can be created in an online environment. Part I of the article begins by discussing trends in online education, explaining tools used to promote learning in the online environment, defining education, and summarizing theories of teaching and learning. This part also examines the lecture as a method of teaching and promoting learning. In Part II, the author discusses the role of the teacher and the concept of teaching presence. This part also comprehensively describes the author's online courses, one graduate and one undergraduate, which were designed to convey a sense of teaching presence. Finally, Part III reports and evaluates the results of student surveys conducted to confirm whether the author, as the instructor, was present in these online courses. The article concludes with recommendations for ensuring teaching presence in online courses.

To this end, the general problem associated with international decision making is first discussed. Specifically, the problem in making good international decisions stems from the complexities of operating in multiple international environments. Managers are confronted with different cultural, legal, political, and economic environments which add a magnitude of complexity to problems that are relatively tractable in a uninational environment. For the purposes of this paper, a generic international facility location problem is developed and solved using a computer based decision making algorithm. The Analytic Hierarchy Process approach uses managerial input to develop pairwise comparisons of relevant decision criteria to efficiently generate an appropriate solution. We argue that because of the unique issues in the international environment that are not easily modeled using traditional approaches, the AHP offers a useful methodology for improving international business decision making. From a pedagogical perspective, this approach offers multiple cross-functional possibilities for classes in international business or global strategic management in addition to building student skills in computer based decision making.","Dubois, Frank L",-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Dubois, Frank L",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,3,55,69,

5,Journal of Teaching in International Business,A Clash Between Cultures,2001,11,3,61--83,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1300/J066v11n03{\_}04,"Abstract Understanding cultures, ours and others, can make for better managers. Employees, customers, investors, suppliers, and other stakeholders are increasingly becoming members of other cultures. Therefore students as future managers need to learn how to understand their own and other cultures and learn about cross-cultural attitudes and relationships if they hope to get effective results out of mixed-culture stakeholders such as these. Improved ways of teaching an awareness of cultural differences are crucial to the development of effective managers and one such procedure begun by Hunt and Allen (1992) provided the basis for our study. Like Hunt and Allen (1992) we continue to focus on the reduction of student cultural hostility; however, we also include improvements to their design of a structured learning experience. A continued theme is one of how cultural awareness could be hampered where critical events between two nations have contributed to building mistrust and cultural hostility. Samuel Huntington's (1993) article in Foreign Affairs, published since Hunt and Allen, has triggered a plethora of debate about whether the next great clash of civilizations, post ?cold war,? will be between Islamic and Western cultures. Cultural misunderstandings and even cross-cultural hostility is often fueled by this type of bi-polar debate which pits two great civilizations against each other. Hunt and Allen (1992) described the use of the case of author Salman Rushdie's being placed under a ?fatwa? or death threat, as a tool for reducing Western students hostility toward the Moslem culture of Iran. We updated the Rushdie case to include the socio-political changes that have occurred in since 1992, including the Huntington materials. We also went further than Hunt and Allen (1992) by adding another important element, the issue of being discouraged from teaching about culturl differences because of an apparently homogenous classroom, espicially in rural universities. When there appears to be very little cultural diversity to work with and build on in the classroom, classroom discussions suffer. One reason for this apparent lack of intereset may well lie in the homogenous nature of the students in the classroom itself. With the help of measures for determining the real level of classroom homogeneity, some elements of subcultural diversity are identified in our classroom which were not examined by Hunt and Allen (1992). We hope these feelings will reduce instructor reluctance to teach about ?cultural differences? in homogeneous classes. Some suggestions are also provided in our conclusions to assist in researching the issues of cultural hostility and classroom homogeneity further.","Hunt, David Marshall",-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Hunt, David Marshall",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,3,61,83,

The goal of this exploratory study was to examine the effect of formal interventions in the classroom on students' choices of group members and whether the interventions helped to alleviate subjective choice strategies. In this experiment, data were collected from MBA students representing five major racioethnic identity groups. It was hypothesized that experiential learning exercises would modify the effects of identity group membership. Repeated measures ANOVAs revealed that the experiential learning exercises had a significant and positive influence on subjects' ability to acquire and assimilate information concerning potential group members beyond the stereotypical categorization of identity group membership. One disturbing aspect of the findings was the parochial response of the Caucasian subjects.

The paper is an anecdotal account to make the point that in non-Western cultural contexts, figurative rather than scientific language often captures the essence of qualitative phenomena. Besides outlining the challenges that a credible and appropriate curriculum in business ethics must address in post colonial Hong Kong, and the steps that have been taken by the School of Business at HKBU to meet these challenges, the paper will underscore the importance of understanding and making explicit the cultural context(s) that have shaped local business environments and customary business practices, as a basis for effective teaching in business ethics. Hong Kong's unique strategic position in the development of a global economy rests upon the historic interplay of Western and Chinese cultures. The moral and religious values that have shaped Hong Kong's cross-cultural social environment must be regarded as a primary resource for business ethics development. As is documented in this report, HKBU's program, with its distinctive focus on the cultural context, may be of benchmark significance for the development of pedagogically effective curricula in international business ethics.","McCann, Dennis P; Chun Lam, Joanna Kit; Chiu, Randy K",17,39,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"McCann, Dennis P","Chun Lam, Joanna Kit","Chiu, Randy K",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,3,23,33,

This shortage is most evident in two specialization areas: high-technology knowledge workers and internationally competent managers. Indeed, American companies rate lack of qualified high-technology personnel as their number one reason for slower than desired business expansion. The other less glamorized, yet serious shortcoming of the American educational system is its inadequate training of cross-culturally competent workers for this truly global post-industrial era. In response to this human resources crisis, realizing that ?the future economic welfare of the US will depend substantially on increasing international skills in the business community,? the United States Department of Education began an active campaign of promoting international education and research in several major American universities in the late 1980s. Since 1988, nearly 40 universities have been awarded tens of millions of dollars to engage in such activities as developing formal international business curricula, offering foreign language courses, promoting internationally-oriented research, provoking international education and research dialogues among the faculty, exchange programs between American and foreign universities for students and the faculty and similar activities. This research is a first attempt in evaluating the impact of one such program on the internationalization level of American students. It will be shown that the international education program at one major American university has successfully produced a cadre of more global and less ethnocentric workforce for American corporations.","Saghafi, Massoud M",-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Saghafi, Massoud M",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,3,63,81,

Based on extensive evaluations, it is found that the commissioned projects should be integrated into the overall course structure and more supports from sponsor firms need to be sought.","Shi, Yi-Zheng; Siu, Wai-Sum",14,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Shi, Yi-Zheng","Siu, Wai-Sum",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,2,1,20,

The theory of cooperative and competitive conflict has the potential to guide conflict training in China. The theory can help managers and employees understand how to make their conflicts productive and learn cooperative conflict skills of direct expression of feelings, an elaboration of ideas, emphatic understanding of opposing perspectives, creating alternative solutions, and accepting new resolutions. Recent experiments show that Chinese values of social face, persuasion, and nonverbal communication, when appropriately expressed, promote cooperative, constructive conflict. Field studies indicate that cooperative conflict contributes to successful teamwork, quality service, and leadership in Chinese organizations. These studies challenge Western stereotypes that China is conflict-negative and autocratic. With cooperative conflict, individuality and freedom of expression very much contribute to group life and organizational productivity.","Tjosvold, Dean; Ding, Daniel",15,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Tjosvold, Dean","Ding, Daniel",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,3,53,75,

One of the most daunting of these challenges is to capture the essence of the global decision making environment where diverse, far-flung operations must function as one to achieve the firm's overall strategic objectives. This paper introduces a strategic planning model that has teams interacting with teams to conduct a comprehensive strategic analysis of a selected multinational company. The byproduct of this dynamic process is a single integrated written analysis that specifies an ?optimal? strategy for the firm if it is to maximize shareholder value on a global basis.","Waldron, Darryl G",-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Waldron, Darryl G",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,3,79,92,

Three frameworks were designed for the IBRM course. The first was a cultural awareness model adapted from Morgan's (1980) idea of paradigmatic orthodoxy getting in the way of embracing new perspectives. The second was key organizing principles (KOPS). The third was a mapping model designed to allow researchers to chart their own cultural position and the position judged to be that of respondents on a set of cultural dimensions deemed to be central to the research context. A student case is used to demonstrate the mapping model.,"Whiteley, Alma",-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Whiteley, Alma",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,2,7,22,

Whilst there is a need for management education in all areas of business within the PRC, it is important to ensure that particular attention is paid to the unique needs of State-Owned and Foreign-Invested Enterprises. It is argued that one such way to incorporate the various influences is through the multiple perspectives approach. In particular, the role of management education and the appropriateness of some teaching content is likely to be influenced by the unique histories of these two sectors, as well as by broader cultural influences common to both.","Zhang, Shiquan; Wood, Elliot; Whiteley, Alma",15,29,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Zhang, Shiquan","Wood, Elliot","Whiteley, Alma",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,3,77,89,

The game simulates three developing economies. Within the economies, each of the students represents an independent economic entity, able to contribute labor, consume goods, and acquire wealth. The game is played in periods, with each one representing a cycle of production and consumption. In one economy, students are free to act independently, or to collaborate, to invest or save money, to innovate or produce conventional products. In the other two, their activities are constrained by ?government? regulations, simulating contrasting strategies of import substitution and export promotion. In the end, students are evaluated according to the wealth they create. The three simulated economies provide experiential evidence as a basis for discussing the relative merits of unfettered free enterprise, import substitution, and export promotion as contrasting strategies of economic development.","Cannon, Hugh M; Yaprak, Attila; Mokra, Irene",15,31,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Cannon, Hugh M","Yaprak, Attila","Mokra, Irene",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,3,23,39,

In so doing, the paper highlights the importance accorded to reforming management education in the successful transition to a market economy. Four models of reforming management education are then outlined and it is suggested that the networking model is the most viable for the Moldavian context. Having accounted for their involvement with the Moldavian International Institute of Management (IMI), the authors proceed to discuss the aims and objectives of the very first indigenous MBA programme developed by the Institute. While the ?management of obstacles? at both macro and micro level has been an arduous task, IMI has emerged successfully out of this task due to the networking approach adopted in the construction of local management knowledge. Its entrepreneurial orientation helped IMI to proactively engage in local and international partnerships with businesses, government bodies, universities, and charitable foundations, a process which facilitated the creation of a network whose long-term survival and central role to reforming management education in Moldova is unquestionable.","Kelemen, Mihaela; Pearson, Gordon; Forrester, Paul; Hassard, John; Railean, Valentin; Hincu, Rodica",17,34,51,66,85,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Kelemen, Mihaela","Pearson, Gordon","Forrester, Paul","Hassard, John","Railean, Valentin","Hincu, Rodica",-x-,-x-,-x-,4,115,132,

However, in-class discussion of case studies suffers from temporal and spatial limitations and, frequently, the limitation of being confined to a single cultural perspective. The development of new forms of Computer-Mediated Communication (such as email, chat rooms, threaded computer conferences, etc.) offers new possibilities to overcome these constraints. Synchronous (same-time) communication via chat rooms or desktop video-conferences may include participants from remote locations who otherwise would be unable to attend class sessions. Non-simultaneous (asynchronous) communication via e-mail and/or threaded discussion conferences can complement traditional in-class discussions and extend the learning environment beyond the assigned classroom meeting times. These new communication possibilities can enable instructors and students from different countries and zones to participate in case discussions and to enrich the cultural dimension of such discussions. This paper presents a framework to classify the different strategies for improving case study discussion with the use of Computer-Mediated Communications and enriching such discussions with the integration of different cultural perspectives.","Benbunan-Fich, Raquel; Stoever, William A",22,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Benbunan-Fich, Raquel","Stoever, William A",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,3,13,27,

CLD programs can assist the Newly Independent States (NIS) in meeting the political, social, and economic challenges associated with the transition from a centralized, administrative command economytoa more democratic and diversified society. Cost-effective, collaborative distance learning projects can help to address the problem of limited educational resources and prepare faculty, undergraduates, entrepreneurs, and NGO leaders for better understanding the role of civic responsibility as a foundation for western business practices. The ongoing Internet-based, Bryant College CLD Program, including educational institutions, research facilities and business firms, focuses on a non-hierarchical model, emphasizing reciprocal, interactive learning and problem-solving. Components include Web-based courses, International Virtual Roundtable Discussions via E-mail, seminars on business skills and Web design, Internet protocol video conferencing between the U.S. and Belarus, a faculty exchange and training project, and a business internship program aimed at providing hands-on experience with business and NGO leaders in the U.S. This project demonstrates that Internet-based, collaborative learning can transcend cultural and language barriers and advance the development of a business environment supportive to the entrepreneurial spirit.","Langlois, Gaytha A; Litoff, Judy Barrett; Ilacqua, Joseph A",19,41,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Langlois, Gaytha A","Litoff, Judy Barrett","Ilacqua, Joseph A",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,3,41,66,

In this study we attempt to profile differences between undergraduate international programs based on the success of the program's placement of students in internationally related jobs upon graduation. We find that schools with good placement success and those with poor placement success largely agree on the elements needed to internationalize the curriculum, although some elements of disagreement remain.

Two central issues that have received recent attention are (1) how to address a rapidly changing and increasingly global economy, and (2) how to infuse technology into the business school curriculum. Both of these issues are changing at break-neck speed, whereas the academic environment, by its very nature and structure, is struggling to meet these demands ata much slower pace. We attempt to offer solutions to these major issues by developing an action plan for international business and technology. One key factor in developing global and technological programs in business schools is the input of its stakeholders-the international and technological business community. In this study, we report the results of an investigation of the international business and technological community's perceptions of the skills they require of recent business school graduates. A total of 126 business organizations provide insights for business schools to develop action plans to address international and technological needs. A discussion and implications of our findings provides an initial avenue for schools to follow in their strategic planning for the future.","Smith, Rachel; Bush, Victoria; Bush, Alan",14,30,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Smith, Rachel","Bush, Victoria","Bush, Alan",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,3,83,100,

It is now quite common for these alliances to offer complete undergraduate and postgraduate foreign sourced degree programs in China. A key issue facing these alliances is how to fund them. This paper identifies a range of funding sources, options and strategies undertaken by Sino-foreign university alliances. These include accessing funds from Chinese State and private companies, charging higher than average fees for courses and associated programs, undertaking research and exchange programs to generate income, delivering courses and programs in a range of locations in China, offering a core range of subjects in a variety of modes to meet the needs of a number of client groups, and focussing on the development and delivery of world class educational programs capable to capturing the elite end of the Chinese education market. A key conclusion is that alliances tended to make use of a (sometimes complex) variety of options and approaches and that no one option was able to completely fund an alliance program. Some of the problems and issues faced by alliance respondents are also discussed, and these included the complexity of developing and maintaining connections and relationships with a variety of funding bodies in China, the difficulty of balancing the various needs and sensitivities of these bodies (some of whom were in competition), the lack of information on a range of possible funding agencies and bodies in China, and the difficulty of balancing the delivery of a world class educational program (which could be very expensive) with the amount of income usually generated from these activities in China. The research notes that if alliances adopt a range of funding approaches and strategies it is possible to adequately fund a range of activities including a high quality degree and/or postgraduate program in China.","Willis, Mike",-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Willis, Mike",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,3,21,59,

This paper suggests an effective model for planning an IFS. It proposes that attention to the rigor and diversity of the actual overseas study will enhance the learning objectives of the program. It further proposes that attention to both the IFS placement within the program and how it is integrated with other pieces of the curriculum will improve the knowledge flow for students.

The global mindsets discussed in the literature coincide with the levels of cognitive complexity found in the critical thinking literature. Building on these traditions, we construct an approach based on facilitated, group discussion. One major advantage of this technique is that, because it is done in a group setting, it is less time-consuming for faculty than other ways of providing feedback to students during study abroad courses. Given that short-term study abroad courses have become a popular way to internationalize business school curricula, this approach offers a way to maximize the impact of these experiences.","Deloach, Stephen; Saliba, Leila; Smith, Victoria; Tiemann, Thomas",17,32,49,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Deloach, Stephen","Saliba, Leila","Smith, Victoria","Tiemann, Thomas",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,3,37,59,

Business schools continue to stress the importance of semester-long study abroad programs. Yet in colleges and universities with a growing population of non-traditional, working adult students, it is challenging to provide international study abroad opportunities. Options for such intensive immersion are limited and may include non-credit travel, travel as a small part of a credit course, or travel with a trade mission group. In short term international travel, quickly introducing students to culture shock and moving toward some minimal acculturation is the primary goal.

This research finds that both sides valued a range of alliance levels, types, activities, sizes and structures but there were significant differences. Chinese respondents tended to prefer larger and higher level alliances which they perceived as being more long term, viable and indicative of foreign commitment. Foreign alliance managers liked to start their alliance associations in China with smaller scale alliance models which could then be expanded into larger and more complex alliances. Chinese alliance managers preferred an alliance model which aimed to establish a benchmark educational standard in China; foreign staff preferred what has been termed pragmatic alliances which were cheaper to organize and manage. Chinese respondents liked alliances which ensured that at least a range of foreign academic and administrative staff were located in China: foreign respondents preferred to fly staff in and out for particular projects and activities. More generally, foreign respondents discussed the value of alliances in business and income generation terms while their Chinese colleagues conceptualized the key value of alliances in terms of their ability to assist China to develop a highly skilled workforce capable of taking its place in an internationalized market economy.","Willis, Mike",-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Willis, Mike",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,2,5,26,

The framework incorporates established and frequently used strategies for developing cross-cultural competence, as well as additional strategies that we have devised (such as diversity audits, self-awareness and ?other?-awareness tools, student-generated cases and virtual linkages). We explain how this approach uses cultural diversity inherent in the classroom as a basis for students' awareness and understanding of cultural differences, knowledge of other cultures and the application of skills.","Ramburuth, Prem; Welch, Catherine",16,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Ramburuth, Prem","Welch, Catherine",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,2,5,27,

Previous research by Willis (2003) identified a range of funding sources available to Chinese and foreign universities to assist them to fund their various projects and activities in China, but did not discuss the issue in much more detail. The present paper takes the discussion further by identifying a range of ?funding categories? into which alliances could be placed, depending on the nature and form of their funding approaches and strategies. For example, some alliances tended to opt for prestige, high cost and world class alliances. These were often expensive to manage and operate (and hence charged hefty fees) but sought to offer superb educational programs for their various student markets. Other alliance decision makers opted for a more pragmatic form of alliance, costed out at a more flexible and generally lower rate. A third group of alliance decision makers offered their programs and course at a cheap rate, usually by delivering basic, unadorned programs and courses, often using distance education modes of delivery. Some alliances adopted a very simple model: they simply charged the Chinese education market the same rate of fees and costs as in their home market, usually to disastrous affectbecause they were simply too expensive for most markets in China. Others opted for volume based alliance tactics (seeking to attract large numbers of students to help cover their alliance costs), whereas another group felt that a more narrow and niche-like approach was preferable. The overall and seemingly most success trend was towards what can be categorized as ?variable funding? alliances, where individual activities and programs were costed out (and priced) on the basis of a range of China based market factors. This more complex approach is a significant move away from more simplistic approaches which were, however, still much in evidence. The value of this paper is that it describes a range of categories and identifies some of the more successful and viable approaches, based on the views of respondents. It is hoped that the findings of the study add to what is a complex but important area of alliance activity.","Willis, Mike",-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Willis, Mike",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,3,67,100,

Often these programs are delivered by foreign academics who teach in these overseas locations. This style and format of educational delivery raises the issue of the degree to which subject material and teaching styles need to be adapted to meet the needs of overseas markets. Using data collected from Chinese university students studying for foreign degree programs in various cities China, this research has found that students wanted only very minor, but still important, areas adaptation of subject materials and teaching styles. Their overall desire was to experience an educational experience that would approximate what they would experience if they studied abroad in the foreign university home campus. If there was a perception that the program had been adapted too much for the overseas market, students would reject it as being unauthentic and bogus. This was particularly important in view of the fact that they often ranked their student status and prestige on the perceived level of authenticity and status of the program. Therefore, the level of adaptation had to be subtle and very minor in nature. This research stands as a warning to universities which might seek to (in good faith) over-adapt programs for markets such as China in the mistaken belief that they are satisfying local needs.","Willis, Mike",-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Willis, Mike",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,3,27,49,

The author demonstrates a new methodology which allows comparison and categorization of nations by calculating a new metric called the Work Culture Score for each nation. This metric allows mathematical comparison between business attitudes in various cultures. It incorporates the average annual hours, percentage of overtime, worker productivity, and attitudes toward work and leisure of a culture into a single, meaningful value. This study applies the newly developed metric to fourteen developed nations.","Belote, Michael D",-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Belote, Michael D",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,4,143,159,

By the late 1990s, a course in international marketing was standard at most accredited college and universities, and faculty in these courses reported on various approaches to teaching the course. The main objective of the current study was to examine the course content, pedagogy, and learning outcomes of current international marketing courses. As such, a content analysis of international marketing syllabi from 89 colleges and universities was conducted. Findings from this indepth analysis offer insights regarding knowledge content coverage, pedagogical strategy, and learning outcomes assessment and provide an update on the current status of teaching international marketing in schools of business.","Crittenden, Victoria L; Wilson, Elizabeth J",23,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Crittenden, Victoria L","Wilson, Elizabeth J",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,3,81,101,

This admixing of material to a large extent comes from the influences of the same cultural and environmental considerations being the source of much information across these courses. The author suggests a way to deal with this admixing through a judicious choice of examples to those impacting the issues in the course. There are many instances where the same cultural or environmental consideration influences some of the main issues in more than one course. The paper suggests the use of an example of that influencer impacting issues that are central to the content of the course being taught. This same strategy involving this same influencer in another course would suggest the use of an example relating to issues pertinent to that course. The use of an influence impacting different issues in different courses forcing a different explanation would help differentiate the courses and also give the student a much fuller and more sophisticated understanding of different cultures. Doing this would increase the cogency of each course and lay a better foundation for the student in understanding the multifaceted nature of the influences of culture and the environments.,"Day, Kenneth W H",-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Day, Kenneth W H",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,3,63,79,

Thus the service encounter in the classroom becomes a subject of increasing importance and interest with respect to satisfactory and unsatisfactory outcomes, and also with respect to related behavioral outcomes such as word-of-mouth and repatronage. This paper investigates these issues in classrooms of higher education by utilizing the Individualism-Collectivism dimension of culture in four different samples: China, New Zealand, Poland, and the United States.

This study focuses on a range of case studies to identify how important various traditional Chinese values were in the maintenance of a successful educational alliance in China. It was found that these concepts, often seemingly so simple and easy to describe, were in reality, complex, interrelated and largely affective in nature. A number of additional cultural dimensions were also identified of importance to these alliances, and it is also noted that at the very core (or heart) of these ventures lay deeply felt guanxi relationships which provided the centre of the alliance ?world.?","Willis, Mike",-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Willis, Mike",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,2,5,45,

Following these focus groups, the problems experienced by teachers working with international students in business tutorials were further explored by collecting survey data from experienced teachers. These data were then used to develop a training program with the aim of improving the skills of teachers in the multicultural classroom.

However, when designing a PbL course one must keep a learner perspective, but never neglect the goal of delivering value to corporate sponsors. PbL is defined in this paper and practical advice is given for the implementation of PbL into international business courses. Corporations can benefit from working in collaboration with student teams and these benefits include access to cost-effective resources (students) and to the expertise provided by faculty. Furthermore, the skills and competencies gained by learners in PbL courses match those sought by companies who are beginning or developing their international business.","Danford, Gerard L",-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Danford, Gerard L",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,2,7,25,

Since literature indicates that training programs based on cross?cultural and learning theories are more effective, this paper examines a training program that Serrie first reported in a 1992 issue of JTIB. The five related and synergistic activities discussed in the paper give participants experience in dealing with and solving real?world problems in cross-cultural management at all three levels. The process is reassessed in terms of recent theory, and to confirm the efficacy of this approach, a pretest?posttest experiment was conducted with a treatment group and control groups. Results show that the treatment group was the only one to show a significant (at p {\textless} 0.05) increase in intercultural expertisea measure of cross?cultural skill. Limitations and implications are discussed.","Sizoo, Steve; Serrie, Hendrick; Shapero, Morris",13,31,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Sizoo, Steve","Serrie, Hendrick","Shapero, Morris",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,3,83,99,

One such career strategy weds a general overarching comprehensive degree with a specific and targeted skill set. This paper provides a viable curriculum path for students who seek global business acumen imbued by an international business (IB) degree yet strive for a career path in a specific business discipline.

The study also looked at how these factors are exhibited by recent graduates of Chinese universities now working in Chinese firms. Questionnaire responses were collected from managers in 113 Chinese state-owned exnterprises (SOEs) and private firms. Managers in both types of firms agreed on the relative importance and presence of the following factors: work habits, teamwork, creativity, ethics, communication, leadership, and business area knolwedge. Respondents gave higher ratings to the importance of each factor than to its presence in the recently hired gradutes. The results of this study provide a management profile of knowledge, skills, and abilities considered desirable by Chinese managers for today's market economy in the People's Republic of China. The identification of gaps between importance ratings and presence ratings provides valuable insight into changes that should be considered by educators in the design of business area currucula in Chinese universities.","Stivers, Bonnie P; Adams, Janet S; Liu, Bin",18,34,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Stivers, Bonnie P","Adams, Janet S","Liu, Bin",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,3,57,80,

This paper considers how a number of foreign university managers selected a university in China. Issues of location, ranking, status, programs, mutual benefit and ?fit? are considered along with less specific and tangible issues related to the nature and environment in which the Chinese university operated. One of the findings of the paper was that identifying and selecting an appropriate partner was often based not only on a range of tangible, cognitive factors, but also on less specific, affective issues such as how the two sides would actually relate to each other at a human level. A second key issue is the observation that foreign university staff had to make the decision between selecting a high ranking Chinese university which had status, ranking, income and-often a wide range of existing foreign partners and a lower ranking Chinese university which had none of these attributes, but which was often a more willing and easier partner at least in the initial stages of alliance activity. Finally, selection was made against a rapidly changing and deregulating university environment in China, making selection both more challenging and demanding than in the past. The paper will be of use to existing and potential foreign university staff wishing to enter this busy market for a range of collaborative activities planned for either China or the foreign country.","Willis, Mike",-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Willis, Mike",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,2,9,43,

Getting these wrong can lead to the third C: conflict. Getting these right can lead to that illusive fourth C: creativity.

Results reveal significant differences in ethical sensitivity only by gender and college major. Female students have higher ethical sensitivity than their male counterparts. Business students have lower ethical sensitivity than students in other majors. However, students demonstrate no significant difference in ethical sensitivity by age, school grade, family income or school ownership status. Having had an ethics course has led to no significant difference in ethical sensitivity either.

When the host country is a former communist state and now a full member of the EU, the challenges are ever present from all who may be regarded as stakeholders. Federal Canadian funding enabled the creation of a local infrastructure, installing library systems and a computer labratory while Canadian professors were being flown in and local professors trained to take over from them. The initiation of an MBA program provided discussion over content, teaching and support but a model was agreed based on tried and tested Canadian programs and local needs and this went on to twice achieve Business Week's {\#}1 status for the best MBA Program in Poland. Despite this, its future was threatened later when the EU proposes to expand the number of MBA graduates in Poland by supporting only local programs. As most of the quality MBA programs are still North American, this would have penalised the quality programs at the expense of the local programs. When this was challenged, the EU retracted and offered a [euro]1 million award to translate the program into Polish. It then became the model for the nation to follow.","Paliwoda, Stanley J; Librowicz, Michel",20,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Paliwoda, Stanley J","Librowicz, Michel",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,2,5,27,

Students indicated considerable satisfaction with their significant investment of effort, despite focusing on only a few concepts in such a comprehensive course. Analyses of student personal characteristics provided encouraging findings that the assignment proved highly valuable for students with significantly different amounts of prior international and technology experience.","Greene, Scott; Bao, Yongchuan (Kevin)",14,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Greene, Scott","Bao, Yongchuan (Kevin)",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,4,272,292,

The learning approaches of these business students were measured using John Biggs's (1987) Study Process Questionnaire (SPQ) to determine whether these students tended to favor surface learning approaches, deep learning approaches, or achieving learning approaches upon initial entry into the university. Changes in learning approaches were tracked, after a semester's exposure to OBTL, through survey and focus group interview methods. Findings indicated a significant amount of transference between learning approaches deployed by these students, demonstrating a high level of adaptability.","Pang, Mary; Ho, To Ming; Man, Ryan",11,24,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Pang, Mary","Ho, To Ming","Man, Ryan",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,4,106,122,

College and university programs abroad can adopt organizational values and identities similar to the home institution, or adapt to local operating environments. Likewise, educational and pedagogic paradigms can mirror those in the home institution or expand to realize and consider local contexts. Based on a consideration of metaphor theory, it is suggested that there are three ways of dealing with international educational experiences. The non?metaphoric paradigm fails to recognize and engage with ambient difference. The comparison paradigm compares and contrasts acquired institutional understandings with local realities. The domains?interactive seeks to stimulate a dynamic exploration of home and local assumptions, looking for new emergent themes and understanding. Insight derived from metaphor theory not only suggests how these different paradigms emerge but potentially provides vibrancy and pervasive urgency to conducting IB education abroad.","StarrGlass, David",-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"StarrGlass, David",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,4,230,243,

We propose a holistic pedagogical approach to studying this market by considering the historical background of the growth of inequality and poverty in different regions of the world, as well as the criteria for segmenting various levels of poverty. A two-pronged approach is then suggested to addressing poverty issues: first, showing how traditional international business principles can be adapted to address the needs of the impoverished market segment using a macro (top-down) approach, and second, how this untapped market can be harnessed for profits while simultaneously uplifting them out of poverty using principles of social entrepreneurship as a micro (bottom-up) approach. Exemplar case studies are used to illustrate these strategies, as are catalytic factors such as investments in technology, education, and capital, which help alleviate poverty in both cases. Finally, a debate about which of the strategies is more effective is outlined with respect to the salient issues.","Roy, Abhijit; Roy, Mousumi",13,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Roy, Abhijit","Roy, Mousumi",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,2,4,26,

This delivery mode is becoming a common form of educational delivery and augments other modes of international activity such as study abroad and distance education. The research has found that students wanted a relatively unadapted course, delivered in English by foreign academics, with a high level of academic and administrative servicing in China. They did not like subjects which had been overly adapted for the Chinese market, since these were viewed to be somewhat lacking in authenticity. However, some very minor areas of adaptation were required to meet some specific local requirements, but in essence students wanted courses which were a close replication of what it would be like to study in the foreign university location, whether it be in America, Australia, or Europe. The value of this research is that it identifies the desire of students for relatively unadapted foreign programs in China. This finding is of use to foreign universities planning courses and programs in China and also adds to the debate about the adaptation or standardization of services in a Chinese context.","Willis, Mike",-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Willis, Mike",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,3,53,68,

This topic has not been comprehensively explored in the past. After looking into the requirements of AACSB, ISO, and the Hong Kong Qualifications Framework (QF), ?mission/objective/goal/outcome, improvement, learning, activities, review, and consistent? were identified as the key elements which can be applied to designing learning activities with a teaching log. From teachers' observations and studying the reflections of learners, it was found that ?Ability, Affection, All-round Development and Appreciation? improved to align with the elements of the mission statement ?Capable and Caring.? It was found that guest lectures by academics and industry practitioners can also help nurture learners' overall development. These findings are of great value as a mission statement is intended to lead to action and continuous improvement; and accreditation exercises involve mission verification and validation. Longitudinal studies of a similar nature are suggested to further test the findings of the present study.","Yeung, Shirley Mo-ching",-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Yeung, Shirley Mo-ching",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,4,243,276,

These goals must be achieved in a world of multilevel access to education and jobs with a more equitable array of opportunities for both developed and developing markets.","Dieck-Assad, Mar{\'{i}}a de Lourdes",-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Dieck-Assad, Mar{\'{i}}a de Lourdes",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,4,168,187,

Although they are both supplementing and replacing semester-long study abroad programs, research has focused primarily on semester (long-term) programs. We draw on the theory of planned behavior (TPB) to explore factors that predict why students choose long-term and short-term programs. Results indicate that students perceive more social pressure to engage in short-term programs, and higher barriers limiting participation in long-term programs. All TPB factors significantly predicted students' intentions to study abroad in both short-term and long-term programs with one exception; perceived behavioral control did not significantly predict intentions to participate in short-term programs. These findings can be used to improve marketing of short-term and long-term programs by addressing student concerns specific to each type of program, potentially increasing the number of students choosing to study abroad.","Fitzsimmons, Stacey R; Flanagan, David J; Wang, Xiaodan Abby",22,41,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Fitzsimmons, Stacey R","Flanagan, David J","Wang, Xiaodan Abby",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,4,125,137,

Based on our experience in DePaul University's AACSB-accredited MBA program in Bahrain, we find that structuring the course content around open-economy macroeconomics requires a background in theoretical models which are beyond the time constraints of an MBA core curriculum. Alternatively, we consider how well a standard applied macroeconomic curriculum of output determination, business cycles, and monetary and fiscal policy can be adapted to students in the Gulf.

This case study presents an exploratory and descriptive research approach to assess the effects of an instructional delivery scenario in which concrescent conversation was used as a communication tool to create a cooperative learning setting in a mainland Chinese MBA course. The Index of Learning Styles (ILS) model was used to determine the learning style preference of the Chinese students. The study also investigated the relation between a student?s preferred learning style with gender and major (business, engineering, math, and science). Sensing-intuitive was the only ILS subscale with a significant difference across gender and major. Females exhibited a moderate preference for sensing learning while males exhibited a mild preference for sensing learning. Among majors, only business and engineering were significantly different from each other. Business majors tended to prefer the moderate sensing learning style and engineering majors indicated a preference for mild sequential learning style. Contrary to the literature on learning style differences attributed to specific cultural orientation, additional observations and results revealed that the Chinese MBA students accepted the instructional delivery scenario in which concrescent conversation was used to implement a student-centered learning setting.","Akan, Obasi Haki; Andres, Hayward; Medley, Barbara C",17,34,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Akan, Obasi Haki","Andres, Hayward","Medley, Barbara C",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,4,283,299,

We present data on the use of immersive experiences, degree of success in student placement in internationally oriented careers, and assessment of internationalization efforts. The results indicate growth of internationalization activities at virtually all schools as expected, but these efforts may not always match AACSB recommendations. For instance, AACSB criticized business programs for not coordinating internationalization activities in a strategic manner to improve courses and develop skills needed by international managers. Our survey finds that many schools do not attempt to tie their international experiences to specific courses, but they report the experiences are used to build skills students need. Most institutions also do not examine job placement as a measure of curriculum internationalization success. We find that many schools do not assess the outcomes of their internationalization efforts in a way that can demonstrate whether or not recent AACSB suggestions are being met.","Shooshtari, Nader H; Manuel, Timothy A",20,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Shooshtari, Nader H","Manuel, Timothy A",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,4,134,156,

However, developing and evaluating such competence is a challenge. One concept that provides a holistic conceptualization of intercultural competence is the notion of ?mindfulness? or the ability to use reflection as a connection between knowledge and action. To facilitate the intercultural learning of a group of MBA students studying global leadership during a cross-cultural immersion experience in China, a model of cultural competence was introduced during their predeparture sessions. In order to demonstrate their understanding of intercultural competence, student papers were analyzed using a coding scheme for reflection. Data show that, overall, students increased their level of ?mindfulness? and became more reflective, and in our hopes, more culturally sensitive as a result of this cross-cultural immersion program.

We used both quantitative and qualitative assessment measures. The findings suggest that several types of learning outcomes did occur through the service learning projects, as the literature suggested.

At the same time, in our capacity as managers of academic programs, it is not uncommon for many of us to overlook the use of research in the management of these programs. While we normally undertake market assessments before establishing new programs, and regularly gather operational data on teaching performance, this paper argues that based on the existing literature, tourism education program managers generally fail to take sufficient advantage of several strategic research approaches that are heavily used in other management contexts. Having recognized their own shortcoming in this regard, the present authors have attempted to rectify it by formally integrating a selected number of widely used research approaches into the overall management of their programs. The results, we believe, demonstrate just how valuable the use of formal program research can be in setting innovative directions for program design and development, for enhancing student satisfaction with specific courses, and for evaluating the overall efficiency and effectiveness of well established programs.

Skiers from three different nationalities were surveyed, and although they were more likely to visit a resort that is environmentally responsible, not all of them would pay more for the privilege. Use of the CVM indicated a strong correlation between WTP and the cost of the holiday, level of income, and level of environmental conscience. The authors conclude that although CVM can provide useful data for tourism decision-makers, it does have its limitations.","Hudson, Simon; Ritchie, Brent",14,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Hudson, Simon","Ritchie, Brent",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,2,1,18,

A multiple case study conducted in 1999 investigated issues associated with the education of ESL students from lecturers' perspectives and identified teaching strategies used by lecturers to counter the pedagogical and ethical issues. Pedagogical issues related primarily to English literacy standards of students, tailoring curricula and teaching practice to meet ESL student needs. Strategies used included monitoring of teaching strategies, provision of additional textual support, mixed groups, interactive learning, team assignments and limited use of examinations. Ethical issues were associated with the business versus academic enterprise of education and accepting students whose language ability was questionable and who subsequently expected to achieve a positive outcome-an English degree.","Jennings, Gayle R",-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Jennings, Gayle R",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,3,35,52,

To be effective, educational methodologies and technologies need to be anchored to the diverse material circumstances characterising different groups of learners. The challenge for universities offering programs of study in tourism and hospitality management is to provide avenues for learning which are reflective of the needs of industry and incorporate the technology now available. One of the more significant responses has centred on the development of educational programs for flexible learning. This paper is an analytical reflection on the experience of redesigning and developing programs in tourism and hospitality to increase student access to a wide variety of stimulating learning resources and delivery media.

The conceptual framework that supports this approach is based on action learning theory and constructivist philosophy. Graduate students in the instructional technology program in the College of Education worked in collaborative design teams with a client, a faculty member from the College of Hotel and Restaurant Management, to design and develop four modules of Internet-based courseware for an actual instructional context in an undergraduate class in human resource management. The course instructor from the College of Education served as a facilitator and project manager. Data was gathered from both the students and the client-faculty member through a variety of methods that included pre- and post-course surveys, participant interviews, journals, and observations. Students expressed satisfaction with working on an actual project with a real client and noted that the skills learned through the collaborative process were frequently used after the course in job-related situations. In the beginning of the development period, there was some confusion and uncertainty about individual and team roles as well as expectations about the client-faculty member feedback and participation. Team building skills were noted as a needed addition to the curriculum. At the end of the development phase, both the students and the client-faculty member expressed a strong satisfaction with the process of combining both technical skills and practice in an authentic context.","McNeil, Sara G; Chernish, William N",15,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"McNeil, Sara G","Chernish, William N",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,4,107,123,

The subject has only recently been adopted and 2000 was its second year of offering. Curriculum was created through liaison and discussion between several staff at the School of Tourism and Hospitality Management in an attempt to link topics and themes to other subjects across the degree program. The case study explores issues relating to curriculum, extent to which the Internet is used within the subject, as well as staff and student perceptions of the course. Outcomes from evaluation and feedback suggest that Internet-as-resource rather than Internet-as-core provides the most flexible and student-centered learning approach.

Since 1994, the number of international students studying for an Australian qualification has risen by 146{\%} (IDP Education, 2001). The majority of these international students come from the traditional South East Asian countries of Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong and Indonesia mainly to study Business and Economics programs. Growth in international student demand is forecast to continue to rise with countries such as China demonstrating significant growth (IDP Education, 2001). This paper attempts to present an analysis of the major issues surrounding the education of Asian students. While mention is made of the predictable problems that all international students face when studying in a foreign country, the focus of this paper concentrates on Asian students' learning approaches and styles and associated problems. This paper evaluates research conducted among all Asian students studying in Australia; however, the focus of this paper is those Asian students who are studying Hospitality and Tourism Management at undergraduate level. The paper identifies both positive and negative images of Asian students and highlights several misperceptions regarding Asian students that are commonly held by western academics. Finally, the paper presents an overview of what strategies might be adopted by western academics in order to make Asian students' experiences at western universities more enjoyable and successful.","Barron, Paul",-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Barron, Paul",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,3,23,45,

Its design philosophy will be discussed thoughtfully with special focus on how to make use of the multimedia and Internet. According to literatures, learning packages are faced to be more effective in delivering teaching material. Researchers indicate that students using a self-paced learning package score higher than in a traditional classroom setting. Moreover, the learning package provides different scenarios for students to explore themselves in a practical environment and is more cost effective and systematic than lectures. Currently, most learning packages in hotel education are not implemented using multimedia with Internet access. Our paper describes a new learning package that fills the gaps. VONNA(HBP) requires participants to investigate operational budgets on various areas such as sales levels, payroll, inventory level, promotion strategies, and facilities planning, etc. Eventually, the students/novices are required to practice their skills in a comprehensive case about a hypothetical hotel. They need to solve managerial problems by a combination of budgetary planning on human resources, staff training programmes, facilities' maintenance and replacement, or promotion schemes. Analytical tools are available for students/novices to judge an appropriate decision in handling constrained resources.","Cho, Vincent; Wong, James",13,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Cho, Vincent","Wong, James",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,3,63,79,

It is an area that, arguably, presents the greatest challenges in adaptation to contemporary learning technologies but, at the same time, stands to benefit most from the potential of the Web. This paper addresses the design and development of a CD-ROM learning resource for food and beverage. It is a learning resource which is designed to integrate with rather than to replace existing conventional classroom and laboratory learning methods and, thus, compensate for the decline in the resource base faced in food and beverage education in recent years. The paper includes illustrative material drawn from the CD-ROM which demonstrates its use in teaching and learning.","Gillespie, Cailein Hugh; Baum, Tom",24,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Gillespie, Cailein Hugh","Baum, Tom",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,3,41,61,

This research investigates the perceptions of hospitality educators regarding business ethics in contemporary hospitality programs and the hospitality industry (Damitio  Dunfee {\&} Donaldson, 1999). This study provides some pivotal educational findings as to how hospitality educators perceive the preparation of hospitality students relative to business ethics. There are three distinctive findings. Female educators have a significantly higher level of agreement toward statements about business ethics in the hospitality industry than do male educators. Educators whose own level of education was a doctorate degree were significantly less concerned about ethics education than educators whose own level of education was a two-year college degree or a master's degree. And, educators who were employed in institutions offering graduate degrees were significantly less concerned about ethics education than educators who were employed in institutions offering undergraduate degrees. In addition to those three significant findings, this study also showed that educators perceive that organizations should not only practice business ethics with customers but also with employees. Additionally, this study showed that educators are concerned about multinational companies (MNC) and students' ability to understand ethical issues while operating businesses in foreign countries. Educators are also concerned about the strong influence of business organizational leadership and management on business ethical practices.","Lin, Jung-Mao (Ronnie); Martin, Lynda; Cobanoglu, Cihan",23,38,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Lin, Jung-Mao (Ronnie)","Martin, Lynda","Cobanoglu, Cihan",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,3,47,59,

However, hospitality education is still considered a relative newborn in comparison with other programs. To develop effective programs, it would be appropriate to investigate competencies that influence career success in the hotel industry and the courses that nurture those important competencies. A researcher-developed survey instrument was used to collect data from 200 industry professionals. Instrument reliability and validity were reported. The results revealed the competencies relating to communication and adaptability most influenced career success.

In this context, the literature indicates that transition to the tertiary institute lifestyle can often result in a period of major personal re-adjustment for first year students, which sometimes manifests itself in early academic results that are below expectations-these twin factors can contribute to early perceptions of alienation and, in some instances, can result in unac-ceptably high dropout rates. This paper describes an intervention that attempted to increase rates of retention in a tourism study programme, through a process designed to facilitate easier assimilation into the tertiary education culture, and to consequently improve the academic results obtained in early course assessment. The nature of this approach, intended to alleviate adjustment problems and provide students with appropriate coping mechanisms, is described in outline, and the results of subsequent student evaluations discussed. The paper concludes by assessing the benefits of this intervention, and by highlighting the implications for future student intakes.","Simpson, Ken; Kingston, Tamsin",13,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Simpson, Ken","Kingston, Tamsin",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,3,21,42,

A research program was instigated to answer two questions: how does analyzing travel writing contribute to student learning in a tourism subject and how could the analysis task be improved to enhance learning? Class discussion, a survey and content analysis were used to investigate these questions. Incorporating an analysis of travel writing into a theoretical tourism subject was an effective way to enhance student learning. It helped students link the theoretical content of the subject and ?real life? and the travel writers' descriptions of interactions between cultures helped them learn about other cultures and cross-cultural issues.","Armstrong, E Kate",-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Armstrong, E Kate",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,3,45,60,

While many have embraced the introduction of online components on the academic experience, some fear that online courses lack the interaction component so critical to the traditional academic experience. In response, there is a growing belief that rather than advocating online or face-to-face learning methods, one should capitalize on the strengths of both methods and examine the effectiveness of blended methods. Therefore, the purpose was to explore the influence of perceptions of online and face-to-face interaction on student satisfaction and performance on a blended learning tourism marketing assignment. The results revealed that students' satisfaction was influenced by their online interactions with other students, the instructor and specific content but that they had no effect on assignment grade. The findings suggest that instructors should consider the use of online tools to improve student satisfaction and that more research is needed to examine the link of online materials and student performance.","Bailey, Keith D; Morais, Duarte B",16,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Bailey, Keith D","Morais, Duarte B",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,3,23,36,

This paper critically reflects on students' expectations and experiences whilst undertaking a flexible course offered by the School of Tourism and Leisure Management for the first time in semester one, 2002 and presents findings from primary research. Data were gathered using three collection methods, results were triangulated and common themes were identified under the general headings of Course Expectations, Attitudes to the Course, Course Experiences and Recommendations for Improvement. It would appear that generally, this cohort of students felt positive about the innovative approach to teaching adopted by this course. While many students expected the course to be taught in traditional mode and had some initial misgivings, it was found that, overall, students felt empowered by the opportunity to take responsibility and control of their learning environment. In addition, the innovative approach to the design, delivery and assessment of this course resulted in a valuable learning experience for many students who stated that they could readily make the link between theory and practice.","Barron, Paul; Whitford, Michelle",13,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Barron, Paul","Whitford, Michelle",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,3,19,43,

Yet the education of the future industry leaders, including an analysis of the doctorate in tourism/hospitality, also deserves attention, especially in a world where strategic tourism and hospitality decisions are requiring more incisive analysis.

These programs continue to expand and flourish during these first few years of the new millennium (Dyrud, 2000). One delivery format involves the use of networked computer telecommunications to create online learning environments (OLE). While the Internet boom that commenced in 1995 is responsible for the proliferation of Web-based programs, online academic delivery methods were in use in the late 1980s. Individuals engaged in OLE prior to 1995 are considered to be the ?early adopters? of the methodology (Hiltz {\&} Wellman, 1997). Many of these early adopters, who possess first-hand knowledge of, and experience with, OLE remain in practice at the current time.

To achieve the ambitious government target, the success of any tourism development strategy will be determined to a large extent by human resources, which can deliver efficient, high quality services. The travel and tourism education in Thailand at an undergraduate level was offered in the Faculty of Commerce and Accountancy, Chulalongkorn University in 1955 under the Bachelor of Commerce Degree with a major field of study in ?Travel Management.? Prince of Songkla University (PSU) brought the concept of community college from the U.S.A. to put into action by setting up Phuket Community College by offering 2-year diploma program in Hotel and Tourism Management to meet the staff requirement of tourism industry in Phuket in 1977. The findings of 'Baccalaureate and Graduate Degrees in Tourism and Hospitality Studies in Thailand: The Current Situations, Problems and Future Development' studied by Chaisawat (1997) and Chaisawat (2000) found that the situation of the universities/institutes that offered programs in hospitality and tourism had changed with a lot of quantity improvement in terms of institutions, number of staff, and number of input/output students as well as research projects. But the very important issues that relate directly to the quality of graduates, problems and constraints running in the hospitality/tourism programs still existed. The National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB) (2004) did an in-depth study of the labour force situation among middle- and high-level personnel within the tourism industry in order to increase productivity and capability of the national competitiveness. Chaisawat and Boonchu (2005) did another study on Baccalaureate and Graduate Degrees in tourism and hospitality studies in Thailand in 2003. Both studies also found that the quantity of graduates from the educational institutions was sufficiently to serve the demand of the industry. However, there were problems in terms of quality since graduates' qualifications were not up to the standards required by the employers. Finally the paper recommended that Thailand should be positioned as a centre for hospitality and tourism studies and training, locating at major tourism destinations. In terms of strategic implementation of tourism development, tourism educations and training institutions should play the catalyst and coordinating roles with the stakeholders in each region or destination.","Chaisawat, Manat",-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Chaisawat, Manat",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,4,197,224,

The development of tourism and hospitality higher education in Taiwan is closely related to the growth in the domestic tourist market and the social development of the country. The earliest tourism education began in 1965. This long process of development has given Taiwanese tourism and hospitality education a multifaceted outlook and is generally divided into three periods: the origination period (1946?1968), the growth period (1969?1991), and the competition and adjustment period (1990?present). Over the past years, tourism and hospitality higher education in Taiwan has witnessed rapid growth in numbers, increasing diversification in program names, and with junior colleges and institutes of technology transforming themselves into universities of technology. Current tourism and hospitality programs are boosting global competitiveness for the future hospitality market in Taiwan, with careful positioning clear goals, curriculum planning, integrating hospitality/tourism curriculum, alliances and collaboration, and strengthening tourism and hospitality research.","Horng, Jeou-Shyan; Lee, Ming-Huei",18,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Horng, Jeou-Shyan","Lee, Ming-Huei",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,4,167,196,

The results indicated that entrance exams were limited in predicting student performance. An admission portfolio approach including entrance exams, high school ranking, leadership abilities, work experience, and references was recommended instead of exams alone.","Hsieh, Yu-Chin; Hu, Bo",15,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Hsieh, Yu-Chin","Hu, Bo",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,2,1,14,

So far, it is hard to claim that Turkey has developed contemporary tourism higher education policies and plans. If Turkey is to gain more from tourism in the long term, it is essential for the country to improve the standards of tourism higher education.

It is a heritage center and leading archeological park that offers visitors an educational experience in a well-kept preserve. The park offers many ancient archeological sites such as the elaborate stone cliff dwelling structures, artifacts, and ceremonial kivas dug deep into the earth. Due to devastating fires over several annual seasons, attendance at Mesa Verde National Park has been disappointing. Capitalizing upon the centennial celebration in 2006, the park's 100th birthday, park officials hope to increase patronage. Historically the park has been partly responsible for bringing several hundred thousand visitors and much of the tourism dollars that flow into the remote southwestern Colorado and four-corners region each year. It is not only responsible for a direct economic impact but also an indirect economic impact found with other area tourist attractions such as hotels, restaurants, and souvenir shops. Thus, lower park attendance figures have a significant impact on the surrounding four-corners region. Tracy Chavis, Executive Director of the Mesa Verde Museum Association, knew all about the disappointing park attendance and problems the park had faced over the past few years and knew she had to do something about it-and she knew she had to do something soon.","Walls, Simon G; Longo, Nicole",15,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Walls, Simon G","Longo, Nicole",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,3,15,31,

Irrespective of high levels of economic development, the two countries also have high levels of tourism intensity when measured either in terms of number of tourists per native population or in terms of tourism receipts per population (e.g., per gross national product). Consequently, both countries also display a long tradition and evolution in their development of systems of tourism education and training albeit under differing market conditions and pressures. Both countries provide similar products like in the field of cultural tourism and alpine tourism. The tourism structure is also comparable. Both countries are dominated by family owned small and medium size businesses. However, their political structures are very different. This paper shows how each country under the three forces of labour market pressures and industry requirements, on the one hand and tourism education policy initiatives on the other has evolved two slightly different tourism education systems. Furthermore, an attempt was made to provide, based on the discussion in the first part of the paper, a more general explanation with respect to the response of tourism schooling/training supplies to varying conditions in tourism product markets, tourism employment and labour market systems, public choice decisions and general economic conditions. Finally, the paper discusses the paradigmatic shift (i.e., structural change) of tourism factor and product markets from the ?Old to New Tourism? and discusses its implications for new types of tourism schooling and training in these two countries.","Weiermair, Klaus; Bieger, Thomas",17,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Weiermair, Klaus","Bieger, Thomas",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,3,39,60,

While there is a variety of research that examines the learning experiences of international students, little research has been conducted that examines the impact that international students have on their domestic counterparts. This paper reports on research that solicits the perceived advantages and disadvantages held by 301 domestic students, who are sharing their educational experience with international students studying hospitality and tourism management. The study reveals that there is a sizable proportion of domestic students (28{\%}) who consider that there are too many international students on campus; that domestic and international students do not readily mix and it also highlights the fact that racist incidents occur.

It has been found that the majority of international students studying at higher-education level in Australia are from Asia and that these students have unique needs and requirements and consequently experience a range of learning issues and problems associated with the move to a western education environment. Concentrating on students who are of Chinese nationality or ethnicity, or who come from countries that share a common Confucian heritage, this paper reports on research that examines students' learning experiences, identifies differences in educational approaches and highlights specific problems and issues regarding students' learning experiences. This research found that these students had to make substantial changes to their educational approach and were required to become involved in a variety of new and unusual classroom situations and had to cope with potentially uncomfortable learning situations. This research suggests that western universities and western academics might take a more proactive approach regarding the learning experience of such students.","Barron, Paul",-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Barron, Paul",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,2,1,17,

The study investigates whether there is a change in students' approaches to learning as they progress through their programmes of study, and the reasons for any change or the lack of change. Data were collected on student approaches to learning at two points: initial entry to their programmes and the beginning of their second year of the same programmes. The study is a longitudinal one. It is hoped that assessing and analysing students' learning approaches and the direction of any change will allow feedback to be provided to department, course teams, and teachers about how they are affecting the way their students approach learning and thereby assist them to work towards continued improvement and enhancement of learning and teaching.","Chan, Benny; Tang, Winnie",12,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Chan, Benny","Tang, Winnie",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,3,41,59,

Despite the importance of internships, there has been limited empirical research in the academic literature on the quality of internships for hotel management students. The three stakeholders, academic institutions (educators), students, and organizations (employers) are important elements in the success of internships. From the viewpoint of students, this study examined the ranking of the level of expectation before placement and satisfaction after placement of selected internship issues, the differences between satisfaction and expectations, and the relation between these differences and demographic characteristics. Upon completion of the internships, it was found that the ranking of student issues was relatively higher than of academic institutions or organization issues. In addition, it was found that the differences on all issues before and after placement were significant. Finally, there were also differences concerning a few issues among the demographic groups. This study concludes that programs need to be improved to make internships successful. Although the study is based on research in Korea, it is argued that suggestions and discussions of the selected internship issues may be potentially applicable to hotel management internships in other countries.","Cho, Minho",-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Cho, Minho",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,3,61,76,

Data were collected via a questionnaire mailed to 649 hospitality and tourism teachers in 105 vocational schools. The response rate was 74 percent. Factor analysis was employed to identify the underlying dimensions of perceived occupational stressors, resulting in five factors: extra work besides teaching; teaching and counseling; academics and licenses; international and personal issues; and administration and contests. MANOVA and ANOVA tests were used to identify if there were differences in perceived occupational stressors by socio-demographic characteristics and organization-related attributes. The results indicated that sociodemographic characteristics and organization-related attributes played significant roles in perceived occupational stressors identified by vocational school hospitality and tourism teachers. Practical implications were suggested for vocational school hospitality and tourism teachers.","Christine, Yu-Hua; Shu, Sun Mei-Chun",18,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Christine, Yu-Hua","Shu, Sun Mei-Chun",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,3,47,67,

This study explored differences between Parks, Recreation, and Tourism (PRT) students and non-PRT students who represented 52 majors on the University of Missouri-Columbia campus. Survey results confirmed that PRT students were more likely to have changed majors. Although PRT students reported lower ACT and GPA scores, no significant difference was found between the two groups in their motivation to learn. However, compared with non-PRT students, PRT students attributed more value to their major when they perceived having more control of their learning.","Cole, James S; Cole, Shu T; Ferguson, Annie P",14,27,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Cole, James S","Cole, Shu T","Ferguson, Annie P",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,3,61,70,

This research was conducted to assess the effectiveness of a new course (Co-Op Management Applications, or CMA) added to the curriculum at a higher-education level. Course effectiveness was assessed from all stakeholders' perspectives; students, sector representatives, school administration, and instructors. Data were collected through questionnaires and interview schedules and subjected to quantitative (descriptive) and qualitative (content) analysis. The findings show that a representative ?needs assessment, facility analysis, and force field analysis? was not conducted during the course development and implementation. Further, the proper monitor of student assessment was not being conducted. It is apparent that a meaningful work experience was being imparted to the students. Early monitor and evaluation could have potentially assured that the students benefited and achieved the course intentions before going forward.","Collins, Ayse Ba",-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Collins, Ayse Ba",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,3,51,71,

This is because group-based or cooperative learning has many benefits to individual student learning (Slavin, 1996). In addition, group work and group assessment, have, over the past few years, become integral components of many undergraduate and postgraduate programmes in the UK and all over the world (Houldsworth {\&} Mathews, 2000). The primary focus of this study is to explore the feelings and experience of students regarding group work and group assessment in Higher Education (HE). The study is exploratory and descriptive based on both quantitative and qualitative approach. Accordingly, the findings reported here are based on a survey and a focus group with some final year tourism and hospitality students (n = 72) at the University of Wolverhampton. Interestingly, students felt that group work is a method that significantly fosters the development of a wider breadth of knowledge through discussion, clarification of ideas, and evaluation of others' ideas. On the other hand, students consider ?poor communication? and ?poor attendance at group meetings? as the main challenges they face when working within a group. Also, students identified ?dedicated assignment seminars? as the most effective tool, which could be used to improve the effectiveness of group work. In conclusion, this study reinforces the findings of previous research into group work suggesting that the experience is generally positive for students. Results are discussed in the context of current theoretical and empirical work on group-based learning. Education implications and areas for further research are also discussed.","Hassanien, Ahmed",-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Hassanien, Ahmed",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,3,17,39,

This paper, with methods of literature review, interview, and pragmatic investigation, researched tourism-related students' work performances under different off-school internship systems. The data gathered and analyzed came from interviews and questionnaires with directors of Personnel, Room Service, and Food and Beverage Departments from select international tourist hotels with tourism-related off-school intern programs in Taiwan. The results showed, in correlated recognition of hospitality and tourism education and off-school internship, no matter what the degree of emphasis or satisfaction was, business directors placed higher appraisals on off-school internship systems of Employment Link Intern Program, Old Sandwich Intern Program, and New Sandwich Intern Program. In regard to work performances, interns did better in aspects of interpersonal relationship, work adjustment, service concepts, and interest for learning, while worse in aspects of foreign language proficiency and customer complaint management. In regard to off-school internship systems, interns of Sandwich Intern Programs (both Old and New) performed better than those of other systems. To be specific, interns of New Sandwich Intern Program fared the best, with those of Old Sandwich Intern Program being second, and those of Vocational Intern Program the third.","Lee, Ming-Huei; Lu, Hsiao-Ting; Jiao, Yuan-Huei; Yeh, Pi-Hua",15,31,48,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Lee, Ming-Huei","Lu, Hsiao-Ting","Jiao, Yuan-Huei","Yeh, Pi-Hua",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,3,69,87,

In theory, by developing technology-based learning environments, students can be stimulated into becoming more active learners. This study explores students' perceived usefulness of an Internet-based hospitality simulation to develop competencies and improve course performance. It was hypothesized in this study that students will have a positive perception of the simulation's usefulness. Data were collected from students who participated in an online hospitality simulation as part of their course requirement. Participants in the current research were from seven different hospitality programs where the course instructor required students to participate in an online virtual hospitality business simulation.

A principal component analysis was used to determine the degree of satisfaction with the supervisor, the educational program, the environment, the administration, and relationships. Training classes made a significant difference in satisfaction with the supervisor and educational program. The regression analysis showed that training satisfaction played a positive role as a predictor of participants' job satisfaction and confidence about future careers. The effect of satisfaction with training on participants' confidence about future careers was mediated by their satisfaction with the internship.

This study analyzed hospitality management student perceptions of learning both inside the classroom environment and in their experiential learning assignments outside the classroom. A review of the literature found documented benefits of experiential learning. This study confirmed many of these previously documented benefits of experiential learning and identified new learning outcomes or benefits for students who participate in experiential learning, such as an increased understanding of how organizations function, increased ability to view career expectations realistically, an increased network of professional contacts, increased ability to take initiative, increased ability to adapt to change, increased leadership skills, and increased financial management skills. This study attempted to identify the statistically significant differences, if any, between student perceptions of learning in the classroom and their perceptions of learning in experiential learning experiences. Unlike similar studies, this study investigated student perceptions of learning in both their classroom environments and their experiential learning assignments at the same time. This allowed the researcher a unique opportunity to compare and contrast the learning environments and identify specific benefits for each.","Lee, Scott A",-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Lee, Scott A",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,3,37,54,

More often they have developed as departments under larger schools or colleges such as geography, recreation, home economics, and business. As a result, the academic field has struggled with an identity crisis of sorts due to the diversity of academic homes and the lack of a widely recognized common body of knowledge that constitutes the core theory and concepts. To investigate the current state of hospitality and tourism management curriculum in all business schools in the United States accredited by AACSB International?The Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business?28 programs were surveyed to determine the depth and breadth of requirements for major, minor and concentration in hospitality and tourism management.

This flexible, student-directed, problem-based approach allowed students to tailor an individual learning program and required them to act as if they were presenting completed documents for a tourism planning group. The evaluation used both class administration data, student performance data and the results of surveys of students to assess a range of indicators including student support for the system, outcomes in terms of enhanced student performance, and the costs of the innovation in terms of class administration time and resources. Overall the results supported the use of the innovation, and the evaluation provided some directions for improved design.","Moscardo, Gianna",-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Moscardo, Gianna",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,4,119,138,

It is a collaborative approach to discussion that seeks to build awareness, challenge assumptions, and reach deeper understandings of issues. From a pedagogical perspective, it has the potential to be a useful alternative to more traditional teaching methods?especially with respect to helping students develop their communication, critical thinking, and analytical skills. While the importance of employing various dialogic management principles in various applied dispute resolution settings is well documented in the literature, little empirical evidence concerning the relative worth of such factors in teaching environments exists. This is especially the case in tourism and hospitality teaching contexts. This article identifies the perceived worth of these factors in shaping dialogues tied to the conflicted and complex topic of hallmark event management. It uses the perspectives of university students participating in a unique ?Semester in Dialogue? program focusing on Vancouver's forthcoming 2010 Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games to measure the value of these factors. The findings suggest that (a) specific management practices related to organizing, planning, and moderating dialogues can create useful learning opportunities for students and other civil society members and (b) well managed dialogues are effective teaching vehicles not only for exploring complex tourism management issues but also for engaging students in discussions that push participants from firmly held positions to new territories of shared learning and mutual understanding.","Ness, Jennifer; Williams, Peter W",15,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Ness, Jennifer","Williams, Peter W",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,4,193,221,

Further to conducting an extensive literature review, a survey was designed and data were collected from faculty members who were teaching SM in T{\&}H schools. The research results did not reveal any significant differences between the undergraduate and graduate level SM courses in terms of course objectives, content, and teaching methods. Overall, they highlight the fact that, the traditional top-down planning school of thought is still very dominant in teaching SM in T{\&}H schools. In-class lectures and case study analysis were found to be main teaching methods used when delivering SM at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. Given the changing trends and new developments in the business environment as well as in SM approaches, the findings raise important questions about the appropriateness of objectives, content, and teaching methods of SM courses in T{\&}H schools.

For this, the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) was applied for measure of cognitive preferences and the Approaches to Study Skills Inventory for Students (ASSIST) for measure of approaches to study. The profile of psychological types in the sample was found to replicate previous studies, suggesting a distinctness of hospitality and tourism students in terms of their cognitive preferences. Correlations were found between the SJ temperament and a preference for the ?Strategic Approach? to studying, which, in addition, led to better academic performance. The results suggest that the learning outcome for a subject needs to be clearly defined and that the acknowledgment of distinct temperaments and study approaches can help foster efficacious teaching modes that discourage surface learning and yield qualitatively better learning experiences.","Aubke, Florian",-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Aubke, Florian",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,3,81,103,

Universities are therefore encouraged to embed key skills in their curricula, yet there is often a considerable gap between what educational institutions offer and what is needed and required by the industry (i.e., there is a need to create a hub and interface between the industry and the institutions of higher education). One attempt to actually create this interface and increase the opportunities for graduates to maintain or obtain employment is to look at diverse skills and competencies that enhance employability of graduates. Although there have been considerable efforts to specify employability skills, the question of how these could be developed within the curriculum prevails. The purpose of the present paper is to theoretically discuss the concepts of employability, skills requirements, and competencies for graduates and to present the results of a quantitative survey carried out among domestic and international Management Center Innsbruck internship partners to assess the required employability skills of the market from the employers' point of view.","Zehrer, Anita; Mossenlechner, Claudia",14,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Zehrer, Anita","Mossenlechner, Claudia",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,4,266,287,

One hundred students were solicited for this study. The instrument measured perceptions toward 23 statements in four sections using a 5-point Likert-type scale. The statistical procedures employed for this study were descriptive statistics, exploratory factor analysis, and multivariate analysis of variance. It was found that the survey used for this study contained areas of concern, and adjustments to the survey may be needed to improve reliability. It was also found that students' post-course self-assessments of their diversity awareness differed significantly from their pre-course assessments. The results of this pilot study could be used by various hospitality organizations looking to obtain a competitive advantage through their understanding and embracing of diversity issues as part of their corporate culture.","Rivera, David",-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Rivera, David",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,3,42,58,

The student evaluation tool (SET) has become the most commonly used measure of teaching effectiveness in a classroom environment. Most food laboratory instructors insist that these criteria are not appropriate when measuring teaching effectiveness in food laboratory settings. A SET previously developed for a basic foods laboratory was used to collect feedback from hospitality educators and students. Also, the researchers wanted to examine the data for significant differences between these two groups. The two groups did view many items of the SET differently, and the factor analysis showed the student section of the SET to be the difference. The study findings can assist educators with improving performance by incorporating student feedback to enhance teaching methods and delivery in a basic food laboratory.","Weber, Melvin R; Chandler, James A; Finley, Dori A",16,35,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Weber, Melvin R","Chandler, James A","Finley, Dori A",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,3,59,74,

Academic program coordinators and administrators have become increasingly cognizant of the complex issues inherent in contemporary tourism studies. As a result, they no longer need to take the initial step of familiarizing themselves with the breadth of the tourism field in developing appropriate tourism curricula, as highlighted by Gunn (1998). Nonetheless, the various models of academic curricula established during the years suggest that the full academic scope of tourism has yet to be fully circumscribed to give due recognition to its multidisciplinary origin and its multifarious concomitant issues. Doctoral research projects and working theses are increasingly adopting interdisciplinary, multidisciplinary, and transdisciplinary perspectives to the study of tourism, and are highlighting the benefit of integrating the foundational meta-theories of these ?mother disciplines? in both undergraduate and postgraduate tourism programs.

Regardless, the findings show a pattern of growing demands on faculty selection criteria. An increasing number of jobs announced during this period required a terminal degree (Ph.D.), teaching experience in two or more subject areas, and relevant industry experience.

Students perceive that a good starting salary, reasonable workload, and good promotion opportunity are the worst performing characteristics for jobs in the travel agency sector. The importance-performance analysis indicates that the travel agency sector needs to concentrate on improving the delivery of job characteristics important to students by providing more opportunities for promotion, making the job more dignified, reducing workload, maintaining work?life balance, and increasing the starting salary. Students with different personal, contextual, and experiential characteristics are found to have significantly different perceptions regarding job characteristics, which are important in influencing their respective career choices and those associated with jobs in travel agencies. Lastly, taking courses related to travel agencies is determined to be correlated with the willingness of students to work in a travel agency.","Lo, Ada S; Mak, Barry; Chen, Yong",10,22,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Lo, Ada S","Mak, Barry","Chen, Yong",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,3,87,121,

Fifty-three articles were identified, with only 14 published in tourism journals, indicating that research utilizing TLT in travel and tourism is in its infancy. Results suggest that a greater understanding of the theoretical basis of TLT, as well as scholarship highlighting intentional, creative, and effective uses of TLT in the tourism classroom is needed.","Stone, Garrett A; Duffy, Lauren N",17,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Stone, Garrett A","Duffy, Lauren N",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,4,204,224,

That being said, with changes accelerating, and global patterns becoming all the more tumultuous the field needs to embrace a new ways of creating sustainable positive change. One area that can benefit this field community tourism development greatly is the study of the connection between types of leadership and effects on follower engagement. The study of the relationships between leaders and followers is important and between charismatic leaders and followers offers key insights. Charismatic leaders are capable of developing effective, or ineffective, relationships with their followers. They also can either foster, or discourage, civic, or community, engagement ? which is critical to the growth of networks, or social capital, in their communities. The research investigates proprietary ways for creating that intersect between tourism and leadership through a teaching case study in order to take the field to the next level of success. The case study of San Luis Colorado provokes learners to analyze and reflect upon charismatic leadership and its effects. The researchers explore the role of leadership in community tourism and the need to integrate this into tourism curricula to build awareness of leadership theory in students and assist practitioners by creating a foundation of new knowledge in the field.","Trudeau Poskas, Denise A; Messer, Cynthia C",25,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Trudeau Poskas, Denise A","Messer, Cynthia C",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,4,186,198,

Nevertheless, the AACSB has become a more inclusive institution, extending accreditation to more schools that are teaching rather than research oriented, namely, those without doctoral programs, with lower enrollments, and with more part-time faculty. The trend has also been to accredit schools with more women and minority students and lower GMAT scores.","Jantzen, Robert H",-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Jantzen, Robert H",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,4,343,347,

It is considerably more difficult to assess teaching effectiveness than it is to assess research productivity, and the fundamental indicator of teaching effectiveness, career success of graduates, is virtually impossible to measure accurately. Business school faculties preparing for accreditation or re-accreditation thus are forced to emphasize superficial and unreliable indicators such as the number of course changes approved by curriculum committees. The AACSB should devise a set of reasonable accreditation standards, with numerical guidelines established for measurable variables, and issue Certificates of Distinction to a minority of business schools that maintain very high levels of faculty research productivity.","Yunker, James A",-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Yunker, James A",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,4,348,353,

Adjunct instructors, hired on a term-by-term basis, are easily replaced; thus, most face serious pressure to earn good evaluations from students. Keeping students happy may mean giving higher, potentially inflated, grades. This study explicitly compared the average class grade given by adjunct instructors and full-time faculty over a 2-year period at a small public university. The results suggest that adjunct instructors do give higher grades than do full-time faculty.","Sonner, Brenda S",-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Sonner, Brenda S",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,2,5,8,

This increased interest is predicated on two assumptions: (a) Chinese students are as receptive to case-method teaching as Western students, and (b) locally oriented cases are more effective than material developed outside Asia. Using data gathered directly from over 76 MBA students at a top Beijing university, this study offers strong empirical support for the use of cases, particularly those concerning Chinese firms. These results also support decisional over illustrative cases, and cases on service as opposed to manufacturing firms, and highlight some significant gender-related differences.","Thompson, Edmund R",-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Thompson, Edmund R",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,4,108,112,

Only 11 {\%} taught such a course at a 4-year institution, primarily to undergraduates. Of those who reported using CBI, most also distributed research-based competencies before assessment, allowed students to test multiple times, provided a grading system encouraging achievement above minimum standards, and used student feedback to improve content and structure of competencies. Significant barriers to CBI included faculty satisfaction with traditional instruction, lack of knowledge about CBI, lack of incentives or resources, difficulty in scheduling physical facilities, and student immaturity in handling the freedom invoved in CBI instruction.","Lynch, David H; Murranka, Patricia",15,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Lynch, David H","Murranka, Patricia",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,4,159,163,

Eighty-seven business majors (43 in accounting and 44 in marketing) returned responses to a questionnaire asking for their perceptions of the likelihood that they and others would engage in unethical behavior, given varying probabilities of their being caught and penalized. Respondents perceived themselves as less likely to engage in unethical behavior than the average person across all scenarios. Results indicated significantly higher levels of self-enhancement bias (SEB) for marketing majors; this difference was moderated by risk. As risk increased, group differences of SEB diminished. These results suggest that SEB may serve as an indicator of engagement in unethical behavior.","Manley, Gregory G; Russell, Craig J; Buckley, M Ronald",18,36,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Manley, Gregory G","Russell, Craig J","Buckley, M Ronald",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,3,21,27,

The authors found that case studies were used frequently, which is consistent with high perceptions of their effectiveness. Their finding that group-process observation and item analysis were used infrequently is consistent with low perceptions of these methods' effectiveness. Five other methods were used fairly frequently. The findings show that, though faculty members use methods appropriate for assigning grades, they demonstrate infrequent use of methods that might be more effective for overall assessment of a program.","Michlitsch, Joseph F; Sidle, Meg Wright",21,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Michlitsch, Joseph F","Sidle, Meg Wright",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,4,125,130,

Under this format, participants were asked to analyze a set of five conflict episodes with differing situational contingencies and to choose action courses from among alternatives for handling the conflict. Group discussion then focused on a comparison of participants' choices of the situationally appropriate or optimal response and their personal conflict-handling orientations.

In this article, the authors show that although EPS comparisons among large publicly traded companies may be appropriate, such comparisons should not be made among small publicly traded firms because the number of common shares outstanding represents a poor scaling measure for entity size.

Both courses involved schematic models in the teaching methodologies, but each emphasized a different model for analysis and synthesis. The Customer Value Funnel (CVF) was an innovative strategic tool used to find competitive advantage. Major strengths of this framework were simplicity, pragmatics, and an interfunctional perspective. The vertically tiered value chain was a supply chain network adaptation of M. Porter's (1985) horizontal value chain. This model enabled students to creatively consider activities that could be implemented in the organization and the supply chain members' firms to create value.","Weinstein, Art; Barrett, Hilton",15,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Weinstein, Art","Barrett, Hilton",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,4,329,336,

J. M. D'Aquila, D. F. Bean, and E. G. Procario- Foley (2004) reported that 97{\%} of business leaders perceive American businesses as ethical, versus 24.5{\%} of students. G. R. Laczniak, M. W. Berkowitz, R. G. Brooker, and J. P. Hale (1995) provided evidence that business leaders feel unfairly maligned and that their actual behavior is positive. Thus, a discrepancy exists between students' and practitioners' perceptions of business ethics, and this discrepancy is a concern because business students become practitioners on graduation. J. Merritt (2003) suggested that the job of cleaning up corporate America lies with management education.

Using a logistic regression analysis, the author also examined 8 factors that could potentially influence students' ethicality. Results indicate 6 scenarios related to 5 areas of the code that deserve special attention and increasing course coverage. These 5 areas of concern are (a) failure to report unethical behavior, (b) improper use of company assets, (c) conflict of interest, (d) inaccurate accounting records by way of channel stuffing (offering a deep discount to customers to overbuy), and (e) trading on inside information. Regression analysis results suggest that female gender, accounting major, full-time work experience, and the number of workplace ethics trainings have a positive influence on students' ethicality. These results should help educators and corporate ethics trainers direct more attention to students or entry-level personnel with these characteristics.","Persons, Obeua",-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Persons, Obeua",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,4,357,366,

As the baby-boom generation approaches retirement, the supply of available replacement faculty members is diminishing. The result is a competitive market for replacement faculty that features increasing starting salary levels. In particular, faculty lines that have been occupied for extended time periods need to be marked to market salary levels because annual salary increases rarely keep pace with inflation in the labor market. The authors report the results of a national survey to determine the amount of salary premium required to bring vacated management faculty lines back up to competitive market levels. As business schools struggle to replace retiring and departing faculty, budgets have to account for these premium increases to succeed in an increasingly competitive market for faculty labor.","Finch, J Howard; Allen, Richard S; Weeks, H Shelton",16,34,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Finch, J Howard","Allen, Richard S","Weeks, H Shelton",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,4,264,267,

The authors developed an experiment to test whether the use of a crossword puzzle exercise would accelerate business student learning of basic economics vocabulary and terminology in undergraduate classes. The findings revealed that working crossword puzzles can help students build and maintain an introductory microeconomics vocabulary. Test results show that crossword puzzles do in fact aid student learning of microeconomics terms and do improve their grades on quizzes.","Lin, Tin-Chun; Dunphy, Steven M",14,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Lin, Tin-Chun","Dunphy, Steven M",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,3,88,93,

Findings confirm these hypotheses.","Alcoba, Jesus",-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Alcoba, Jesus",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,4,119,125,

A poster project that culminated in a professional-style poster session was assigned. Students completed a group project producing a poster describing the production process of a manufacturing company and determining the most appropriate costing system for that company with underlying reasons. Two questionnaires were conducted after each assignment in order to measure the effect of the poster project on the motivation and learning of the managerial accounting students. This pilot study is the first to explore perceptions of poster projects as a motivational and learning tool in managerial accounting courses in the world.","Altintas, Nergis Nalan; Suer, Ayca Zeynep; Sari, Emre Selcuk; Ulker, Mirac Sema",23,42,61,-9,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,"Altintas, Nergis Nalan","Suer, Ayca Zeynep","Sari, Emre Selcuk","Ulker, Mirac Sema",-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,-x-,4,196,201,
