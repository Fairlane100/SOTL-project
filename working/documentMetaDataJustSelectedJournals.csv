"1025","A Required GVV Ethics Course: Conscripting Ethical Conversations","Stacie Chappell Dave Webb Mark Edwards",2011,"Journal of Business Ethics Education","116be73f-8844-3cd9-9a80-6964226ad01c",NA,"Business schools around the globe are seeking effective ways of incorporating business ethics into their programs (Melé 2008, Swanson 2004). Indications from both the market and accrediting bodies suggest best-practice programs will include ethics education. However, the debate continues as to whether meaningful learning is best achieved through stand-alone ethics experiences or via an integrated theme across the program of study (Tesfayohannes & Driscoll 2010, Wilhelm 2005). While many examples of required ethics-experiences can be found, to date, there is only one business school that we are aware of that has implemented a required full-term postgraduate ethics course based on the Giving Voice To Values (GVV) (Gentile 2008) philosophy and content.The purpose of this article is to share the tacit knowledge gained in the authors' experience of implementing such a course at the University of Western Australia's Business School.

"1026","Developing an Ethics Education Framework for Accounting","Steven Dellaportas Beverley Jackling Philomena Leung Barry J Cooper",2011,"Journal of Business Ethics Education","49d8ee15-0666-343f-a95e-514455ac7319","cognitive processes decision-making education ethics teaching theoretical model","The purpose of this paper is to propose a framework of ethics education that promotes the structured learning of ethics in the accounting discipline. The Ethics Education Framework (EEF) is based on three key inter-related components that includes: Rest's (1986) Four-Component Model of ethical decision-making and behaviour; the key cognitive and behavioural objectives of ethics education; and the discrete and pervasive approaches to delivering content. The EEF provides university students and professional accountants a structure to learn to identify, analyse, and resolve ethical issues to the point of action. The EEF is a four-stage learning continuum represented as a set of building blocks which introduces ethical concepts and then reinforces and develops new levels of understanding with progressive stages. This paper describes the EEF, and includes a discussion of how it compares with other ethics education models, and an analysis of the support through responses by professional organisations (based on an Exposure Draft issued by the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC), as the initial International Education Practice Statement). The IFAC has now revised its International Education Standard (IES 4) in relation to ethics, with a commentary period till July 2011. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]"
"1027","A Faculty Forum on Giving Voice To Values : Faculty Perspectives on the Uses of This Pedagogy and Curriculum for Values-Driven Leadership","Mary C Gentile",2011,"Journal of Business Ethics Education","1c503645-f75f-3530-93f9-1011b7e7ce57",NA,"Giving Voice To Values (GVV) is an innovative approach to values-driven leadership development. The Giving Voice To Values curriculum includes a set of exercises, readings and a unique type of case study wherein students are asked to develop scripts and action plans for a given values-driven position. The collection also includes faculty teaching notes, video interviews, and a book that outlines the entire approach. When it comes to curriculum development, readers will come to understand a variety of methodologies for creating new GVV cases: working with students and their internship experiences at the University of Texas-Austin; developing GVV cases that grow out of and feed back into traditional research projects at Washington State University; and crafting GVV-style teaching notes for existing case studies as at Simmons University School of Management."

Using Rest’s Four Component Model as a framework, this study examines the relationship between the first two components of moral sensitivity and moral judgment. The study utilises two scores from the same cohort of computing undergraduates: a score for ethical sensitivity using a devised dilemma analysis; and a score for change in moral judgment resulting from an educational intervention, using the Defining Issues Test (DIT). Although average DIT scores showed no significant improvement in moral judgment, this study found that levels of ethical sensitivity had a significant impact on the development of moral judgment. The paper provides evidence that ethical sensitivity appears to play a key role in the development of moral judgment. Therefore an initial key objective critical to any ethics course should be to raise student levels of ethical sensitivity as a necessary foundation for development of moral judgment. The paper also highlights the wide range of levels of ethical sensitivity measured within one cohort and suggests targeted learning support should be provided to students who score in the lower part of the scale to raise their levels of moral sensitivity early in the course."

This has presented managers with several ambiguous problems and tricky ethical dilemmas. Managers need to develop new competencies to cope, especially enhanced self-awareness, an ethical orientation, and the ability to think through, make judgments on and implement action after consideration of multiple (stakeholder) perspectives. Management education in India is yet to respond effectively to the new competency requirements. There is need to introduce changes in the curriculum to inculcate these competencies. In this context, the suitability of the GVV approach to teaching ethics is reviewed. The evidence from the initial experiences of using the GVV approach in India, while anecdotal, has been positive."

After a brief discussion of business school responsibilities and the teaching of ethics, the article looks at efforts to integrate the teaching of ethics across the curriculum. Then, findings from a small pilot study among business ethics and business school colleagues are summarized and discussed, with a focus on guest lecturing and team teaching, both with regard to experience and to faculty's willingness to try. A final section of the article formulates recommendations for how our theory could be translated into practice. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]"

Yet, little empirical evidence exists on the factors affecting business graduate ethical development and behaviour using an Islamic perspective. This study examines the effects of mentoring support, the perceived standard of ethical conduct of peers, and individual ethical attributes of National female (Emirati) business graduates from the United Arab Emirates. Research has shown that formal and informal mentoring relationships benefit new employees by enabling them to further learn and grow within an organisation. On the other hand, some employees have also shown that these relationships can have a negative impact on a new employee's ethical orientation. The aim of this study is to investigate the ethical orientations of Emirati female business graduates as they move from the relative sanctity of home and university into a new multicultural, westernised business environment. The results suggest that the ethical evaluations and behavioural intentions of Emirati graduates are affected by a multiplicity of sources including professional bodies and both mentors and peers in the workplace. It may be prudent at such a significant time in the UAE's development that educators consider introducing ethical education into tertiary curriculum."

Students identified multiple decision criteria (financial, ethical, etc.) relevant to the dilemma and then recommended a decision, reflecting a prioritizing of the multiple decision criteria. The goal of this research was to learn whether personal experience led to different decision priorities. Analyses from 121 students taken from six semesters of the course were sorted by choice of topic, as well as by which decision criterion was given top priority. Results showed significant differences (Chi-square value of 38.50562, significance level of 5.45963E-10) between the personal examples and the news examples. Students typically put ethical concerns first when analyzing news events. However, when it came to personal events, more self-serving concerns often took priority. These disparate results suggest that even when knowledge is gained from study of theory and cases, it may not be applied to dilemmas that arise in students' own experiences. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]"

This era, marked by increasing calls for accountability interwoven with movements that illustrate business's potential for good, may leave these emerging professionals shaking their heads. To consider the impact of business in society, people must acknowledge the formative role of business schools. Consistent with outcomes from other studies, students who have completed a course with substantive ethics content at one top-tier business school show solid grasp of the concepts and theoretical foundations of ethical decision making but room for growth in translating ""knowing"" to ""doing"". One promising approach is the Giving Voice To Values (GVV) curriculum. This essay explores one school's incorporation of the GVV model, complemented by the school's three-tiered approach to thought leadership and education based on the promise of business as a prosocial enterprise, and presents suggestions for future research indicated by preliminary findings with students who have successfully completed a GVV course."

That said, continually refreshing any course, but especially a course that deals with ethics, with cases that are relevant and compelling to students can be a challenge for a variety of reasons. Some of these reasons are common to many of the business disciplines, and some are unique to ethics. Using the case writing assignment in an internship course has been amazingly effective both as an educational experience and as a means of generating new curriculum material. The case writing assignment adds an intellectual component to the internship experience and insures that the students have substantive conversations with some professionals whom they would like to get to know. Some of the cases that the students have generated have been quite good, and in fact, a few of them are posted on the GVV Website and have been used in multiple countries."

In this paper, I discuss an experiential learning approach that links Robin Hogarth's (2001, 2008) work on the learning of intuition with Mary Gentile's (2010) educational program on values-based leadership, Giving Voice To Values (GVV). Building on Hogarth's proposal that intuitions are primarily acquired and thus shaped by our experiences, GVV offers a pedagogical framework for reflective, experiential learning. Specific attention is given to the themes of learning environments, how these structures shape intuitions, and how students can identify these structures using the GVV emphasis on examination of past experiences."

It was the 2007 Assessment of Learning (AOL) workshop at the School of Management, Simmons College, and faculty had just learned that students had not performed well across several categories related to ethics and the school's mission of educating women for principled leadership. The data moved the deans and faculty to act quickly and by January following the December AOL workshop, several faculty were working with Mary Gentile to apply the Giving Voice To Values (GVV) methodology to specific disciplines within the MBA curriculum. By January, 2008, interested faculty members were working with Gentile to incorporate GVV into their courses. In the August, 2008, Foundations' Orientation Program, students were introduced to GVV through a lecture and a case discussion. This modest beginning opened the door to the eventual integration of GVV into five core courses in the MBA Program."

Causal Loop Archetypes offer a basic systems framework for analyzing the unintended consequences of personal and professional ethical decisions. Pressure or enticement or defensiveness can stymie individuals' rational sense-making. Causal Loop Thinking, and in particular the ""Fixes That Fail"" Archetype, draw on the familiar decision model of identifying the problem, specifying the alternative courses of action and their consequences, to guide our final choice. As students grapple with their own conflicts and business school faculty look for tools to anticipate professional ethical dilemmas, Causal Loop Thinking can expand our awareness of the context of choices and actions, thus leading to a more fully assessed decision."

Legal regulations form the essential boundaries of the business game. Many students do not realize the degree to which law is dependent upon ethical actors to achieve its objectives. At least three examples are insightful in this regard: First, the interpretive requirements of legal rules often rely on the ethical character of the interpreting business actor to achieve their objectives. Second, law does not prohibit harms from occurring, it only associates costs with behaviors. Third, law cannot compensate society for non-fungible harms. Legal regulations do not sustain the orderly function of society without ethical business actors. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]"

An integrated curriculum spans the boundaries between traditional areas of knowledge and uses themes or phenomena to teach a variety of subjects. It is student centered, rather than instructor or topic centered (Bailey 2011) and capitalizes on the ways in which the brain learns (Caine & Caine 1994) by enabling the students to make connections across a variety of ideas. Simmons School of Management educates women for power and principled leadership. Their focus on ethics and social responsibility is part of their DNA. In 2008, they strengthened their emphasis on educating principled leaders by adding the GVV curriculum to their existing required course that covered ethics (Leadership, Governance and Accountability) and integrating it across a number of the required MBA courses."

The results indicated that level of moral development did affect the decisions of students; however, main effects for gender, the level of education, and context were not significant. The results did find significant interaction effects between context and moral development and gender and moral development. Students with lower levels of moral development were less likely to consider the contextual situation when making their decisions. The effect of moral development was more pronounced for female business students than for male business students. The implications of these results for ethics education in business schools are discussed. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]"

Almost all of the financial executives involved in the crisis, from CEOs to middle managers, are products of our business schools. Additionally, there is a high correlation between the recent unethical behavior of a number of multinational corporations and the number of MBA holders in their top ranks. As a consequence, many critics are convinced that there is something wrong with our business schools. This paper presents the causes and consequences of what ails business school students and graduates today: the toxic teaching of bad management theories. These theories- grounded in the assumptions of economics-include determinism and materialism, the cult of profit maximization and a pessimistic view of human nature as totally self-interested. By teaching these theories, business schools are inculcating values of materialism and greed that create a life-long pursuit of money and status. This makes it all too easy for business managers to choose expediency and short-term profits over ethical behavior. Further, these materialistic values create higher levels of depression, anxiety and psychological disorders as well as make our students less cooperative and more anti-social as individuals long after they leave academia."

The influence of this ethics component on students' ethical perceptions-where ethical perceptions are represented by the extent to which students' conclusions regarding unethical actions coincide with those of experts in the field-is then assessed using computer-based scenarios to represent seven categories of ethical norms. The ethical perceptions in each of the scenarios are then statistically compared between two groups of students, namely those who have studied the ethics component and those who have not. Results indicate no significant difference in ethical perceptions between the two groups across all of the ethical norms.

The two most important internal relationships in an individual company's social system are those between managers and owners and between managers and employees. The methodology recommended in this paper supports the inclusion of four modules in a business ethics course, each of which has its own core concepts. These modules are: 1. stakeholder management module, 2. corporate role and social responsibility module, 3. ethical principles module, and 4. corporate micro question module Business ethics methodology should start by sifting through the many relationships in which the company is embedded. It should then define corporate social responsibilities, closely examine corporate ethical principles and policies, and stop at guiding and critiquing corporate ethical behavior. Business ethics teaching should therefore consist of four modules: stakeholder management, the corporate role and CSR, corporate ethical principles, and ethical questions in micro corporate activities."

One is the Critical View. This camp maintains that business ethics should make full use of its theoretical arsenal to rectify and restrain negative phenomena in business activities, such as the moral depravity and greed resulting from a doctrine of profit-above-all. Contrary to the Critical View is the Apologetic View, which argues that business ethics should provide theoretical justification for profit-seeking activities-just as our current ideology creates a moral defense for the market institutions that China has already chosen, and for the underlying principle that values efficiency and profits above all else The author favors a comprehensive moral system that incorporates multidimensional and multi-layered moral obligations and encompasses both common value judgments and the noblest aspirations.

The research, conducted over five semesters at a Midwestern university, resulted in the development of teaching methods and materials that can, when properly sequenced and integrated into undergraduate business courses, increase levels of student moral reasoning as measured by the revised version of the Defining Issues Test (DIT-2). Findings in this research demonstrate that faculty members who are not specialists in business ethics can effect positive increases in student moral reasoning in non-ethics business courses. However, significant time and effort must be invested in case-based moral decision making, and grade incentives for students to engage the use of an ethical decision-making framework are required.

However, a pleasant training experience is no guarantee of its ultimate success in improving organizational ethics. Drawing on Paivio's Dual Coding Theory, this paper presents a model for evaluating multimedia learning from a moral viewpoint. The main argument advanced in the paper is that entertaining multimedia training modules, as commonly offered in the business world, may deliver an unintended message which runs counter to the very goal of ethics training. The Rocked or Shocked? videogame-a multimedia-based ethics training module-will serve as a case study for detecting the complicated role of entertainment in ethics training and examining the ethical meanings conveyed through the pictorial/event channel. The paper concludes with recommendations for the design of multimedia ethics training. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]"

GVV has two distinct advantages working for it. First, students articulate ethical responses on their own terms. The second advantage is the platform that GVV provides to faculty. Academics feel most comfortable on their own turf and those in economics and finance receive very little incentive to do research on business ethics. In comparing remarks it is evident that students in economics and finance are capable of discussing their subject matter within an ethical context and welcome values-based discussions within a business context. Giving Voice To Values provides the bridge for faculty in economics and finance to engage students in such conversations."

A total of 264 accounting students attending ethics courses in public and private universities responded to a pre and post questionnaire (treatment group) and another 57 students who did not complete an ethics course (control group) were included for comparative purposes. Statistical analysis reveals that business ethics courses are effective as students demonstrate higher level of ethical sensitivity upon completion of the course. In contrast, the control group students demonstrate lower levels of ethical sensitivity. Students in the ""good"" and ""average"" academic performance category, females, and Malay students, gained most from an ethics education. Students from public universities were also found to benefit more than their private university counterparts. The results contribute to the dearth of research in this area and present a case for introducing compulsory business ethics courses in all Malaysian universities offering accounting programs.

These offerings represent business administration studies in all Spanish universities, as well as postgraduate programmes taught by the universities themselves and/or other business schools. This is of special relevance because there are few data for assessing how our executives are trained, even though such data are essential to any attempt to improve corporate performance. Clearly, business ethics, corporate social responsibility, and other core courses related to sustainability can and should contribute to this end. But the actual results are not very promising: these essential courses are offered in a minority of postgraduate programmes, and they barely exist at the undergraduate level. We consider it long overdue that academic institutions explore the inherent value of this type of training and seriously reconsider alternative course planning for their students.

This paper seeks to explore how ethics can develop beyond the curriculum, and some methods by which business schools might promote effective ethical self-development. Four basic ethical concepts are used as potential starting points for business school faculty to engage with business ethics beyond the curriculum: moral conflict, role morality, moral codes, and moral climate. Through a discussion of these, eight theses are developed for further discussion and are suggested as a framework for future comparative research about business school ethics."

Ethics courses are often labeled ""business and society,"" or ""corporate social responsibility,"" but the label doesn't really matter. For students to really connect the dots, professors must show them how the normative issues span the relevant levels of analysis, which include the macro environment, stakeholder groups, industrial forces, corporate cultures and chain-of-command structures, and individual decision making. There is a social contract between business and society, and students should understand this. A good ethics education will help students connect all these dots across all these levels of analysis. It will help them understand that the different levels are related and don't exist in a vacuum."

The title ""Ethics, Values, and Integrity in Management"" instead of ""business ethics"" was chosen on purpose in order to allow students-who all come with extensive job experience-to distinguish on their own between moral leadership and ethics management by the end of the course. The ultimate goal of the course is to help students understand the normative demands of good leadership without sacrificing either managerial effectiveness or ethics. Especially, when the international student body consists of participants from different parts of the world, it was important to make sure that students could relate ethics to the concept of leadership based on their own cultural traditions. A short survey conducted for this paper among the alumni MBA students yielded information about the usefulness of the course after it has been running for 10 years. The survey confirmed increased ethical awareness and the usefulness of skills for moral reflections and decision making. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]"

There are two problems with this battle cry. First, the AACSB rejects, with weak arguments, the single best way to get ethics into the curriculum. Second, the AACSB can only vaguely describe some unpromising alternatives to that strategy. A number of leading business ethicists have challenged the AACSB to defend and clarify its views, to little avail. The proposed Procedures and Standards cannot by themselves bring about any significant change in the teaching of business ethics. There is a gap between the AACSB's professed objectives and the means for achieving the objectives and determining whether they are being achieved. The Statement about Curriculum Content gives great prominence to the teaching of business ethics, but the interpretation of the statement, especially in the standards for measuring achievement, shows how improbable it is that the proposed Procedures and Standards will have the desired impact. We must recognize the constraints on the AACSB as we consider current standards and the controversy over a free-standing course versus an integrated curricular approach. The evident conclusion is a call, not only to the AACSB but to all business school educators, to set the stage for strengthened ethics education rather than to have standards imposed on us from outside.

This paper states a case for an independent foundation course, required universally at undergraduate and graduate levels of business or management education, addressing businesses in societies, legal environment of business and business ethics. Independent foundation instruction by specialists should be followed universally by systematic infusion of these areas throughout business curricula.

The mistakes and confusion that underlie these arguments are exposed. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]"

Originating as a conference debate, it takes as its theme the notion of ideological 'neutrality' and the role of the business ethics teacher. A position statement outlines an argument for 'restraint' as a modern day Aristotleian mean to protect student academic freedom. Two responses follow. The first of these provides a moderate advocacy position based on Socratic principles. The second response outlines the notion of teaching as a relational process necessitating delayed disclosure and moral courage on the part of the teacher. The paper concludes with a brief reflection by the author of the position statement. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]"

These cognitive and behavioral limitations not only cause inefficient decision making, but also lead people to make decisions that are unethical. This article seeks to introduce a selected portion of the heuristics and biases and related psychological literature, to highlight its implications for ethical decision making, and to serve as the basis for a lecture that could inform students regarding these matters. If business actors are on guard against errors in their own decision making processes, perhaps they can avoid some of the ethical pitfalls that recently put Enron and so many other companies in the news."

Students come to undergraduate and graduate education with their own ethical schemas, frameworks and perspectives. It is not likely that professors can teach business ethics in a way that will alter previously conditioned positions. Regardless of the personal positions that students bring to the classroom it is important that they understand both the macro and micro business ethics issues and how these issues are central to their lives and careers, and how their personal choices and actions will impact the free enterprise system as a whole. The ability of the individual to make honest choices is as vital to the individual as integrity and transparency are to the organization and the free enterprise system. Sustainable interpersonal relationships require trust just as sustainable enterprise relationships require trust."

Culture entered the evolutionary picture when ancient ancestral brains began spewing out streams of symbolic signals that, when taken together and passed from person to person via language and imitation, built a new dimension of learning and adaptational flexibility. Business ethics is about actual behavior, not simply what one might wish it should be. Business ethics is ""done"" by business practitioners as they go about their daily work. To get students -- young and old, beginners and veterans, academics and executives -- to see that a morally satisfying professional life and career, one that serves the public as well as oneself, is best achieved by building it on the behavioral realities found within human culture and human nature."

The purpose of this study is to investigate which Excel functions are perceived to be important and useful for new hires to understand prior to starting a job in public accounting. We collect survey data from four large public accounting firms as well as undergraduate and graduate accounting students (i.e., potential new hires) to gauge perceptions of Excel importance, knowledge, and usage in public accounting. We find that employees at the firms believe the most important Excel functions are: basic formula, filter and sort data, vertical (horizontal) lookup, formatting of documents, and If/Then statements. In a comparison of new hires at public accounting firms with accounting students, results suggest that accounting students underestimate the importance and usage of some of these Excel functions. In addition, results suggest that new hires' perceived knowledge on how to use specific Excel functions in their accounting job is statistically different than students' perceived knowledge on how to use some of the same Excel functions. Our research contributes to educational accounting literature by documenting which Excel functions employers in public accounting want new hires to know prior to starting a job in public accounting. Also, this research informs accounting educators that students' perceptions are not the same as public accounting employers' expectations with respect to analytical skills using Excel technology. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd."

Instructors of this course have the daunting task of teaching students how to report information in a way that it is meaningful to managers. These reports must adhere to principles not necessarily pertinent to the financial statements with which students are already familiar. These principles of management reports include concise and timely reports, inclusion of physical as well as monetary data, and exception reporting. The authors have developed and used three different teaching cases that resemble real-world experience to help students understand and apply these reporting principles. These cases can be used individually, and instructors might choose to use more than one of them in their AIS course. In addition, these cases challenge students to develop data coding methods that must be used to enable the generation of reports adhering to these principles. Learning objectives, implementation guidance, and teaching notes are provided. Feedback from students on the use of these cases has been overwhelmingly positive. The cases were administered at two universities (the authors' university and another university) during the fall 2013 semester. The questionnaires administered to the instructor and the students are provided. Results included in this paper suggest that both the students and the instructors found the cases interesting and useful. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

The issues are explored by a review of the literature in accounting and other professions regarding the respective roles of universities and employers in the development of both technical and non-technical knowledge and skills of professionals, particularly accounting practitioners. The literature review suggests that critics of university-based education fail to recognise (a) the changes that have occurred in the roles and responsibilities of accounting practitioners, and (b) the opportunity costs necessarily associated with providing generalist accounting degrees. Universities and employers have comparative advantages for the development of different types of professional skills and knowledge. These insights are extended by way of a series of interviews with Australian accounting practitioners, representatives from professional accounting bodies, recent accounting graduates, and accounting students about their perceptions of the respective responsibilities and roles of universities and employers. Although some interviewees recognised that universities cannot be 'all things to all people', there was a tendency to expect universities to have the major responsibility for the development in accounting graduates of both technical and non-technical knowledge and skills. Such perceptions tended to understate the responsibilities and comparative advantage of employers and result in unrealistic expectations about the outcomes of a university education. Employers need to be made more aware of the resource and other limitations associated with university programs and should develop meaningful opportunities for learning and reflection within workplace contexts. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd."

Several of these call for higher degrees of cooperation and collaboration between accounting academics and accounting practitioners. The fact that a schism of sorts has developed between these groups needs to be better understood if progress can be made in bridging that divide. This paper studies one aspect of this issue by focusing on the extent to which accounting academics hold practice credentials. Several hypotheses are offered to explore patterns whereas academics become less likely to share this critical designation with accounting practitioners. The paper suggests that practice credential differences might indicate divergent values and priorities that will pose an obstacle to the cooperation envisioned by the Pathways Commission.

The DaimlerChrysler (DC) case provides an opportunity for you to research key financial reporting concepts, analyze accounting policy differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS, determine adjustments necessary to convert financial statements from U.S. GAAP to IFRS, and compute and discuss key ratio impacts following financial statement conversion. This case demonstrates that transitioning to IFRS is more than an accounting issue; it provides opportunities for financial restructuring (e.g., Daimler's amendments to pension plans and its 2007 sale of Chrysler). It also illustrates the importance of professional judgment when initially adopting IFRS accounting policies. Also, despite FASB and IASB convergence efforts, you learn that most of the key differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS identified in DC's reconciliations continue today. This case helps you to: (1) develop skills to interpret and apply the requirements on first-time adoption of IFRS to a real-world setting; (2) research key differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS and their effects on the financial statements and ratios; and (3) understand significant impacts of the transition to IFRS on businesses and financial statements.

For these practitioners, spreadsheets are necessary tools for traditional responsibilities such as planning, budgeting, forecasting as well as newer decision-making responsibilities. Responsibilities for managerial accounting practitioners have shifted from a transaction-based focus to an emphasis on decision support, planning, and control. Managerial accountants are expected to be key members of decision making and cross-functional teams outside the accounting area. Spreadsheets are major tools for meeting these new responsibilities. However, there is a significant gap in the literature with respect to what features of spreadsheets are most relevant for these new responsibilities. The purpose of this exploratory research is to provide evidence as to (a) what features of spreadsheets managerial accountants use, and (b) what features of spreadsheets new hires are expected to use."

Researchers have questioned whether there should be different assessments of reading comprehension for different demographic groups. This paper explores differences in the reading comprehension of a diverse cohort of South African financial reporting students. Many students demonstrated reading comprehension at the Independent or Instructional Level. Further analysis revealed statistically significant differences between reading comprehension by language of instruction and the attendance, or not, of prior reading courses.

The instructional exercise described in this note illustrates the deleterious effects on audit effectiveness of this predictability. Numerical examples and student decisions are used to show that the probability that the auditor will detect intentional misstatements (fraud) may be reduced dramatically if the auditor does not recognize the strategic aspects of auditing."

Recently, the Pathways Commission called for greater integration of PO faculty into accounting programs and research. In addition, the AACSB recently modified its accreditation standards to enhance the practice relevance of teaching and research. Given the importance of PO faculty to accounting education, this study reflects a systematic effort to assess the interests, needs, and aspirations of current PO faculty to help facilitate the integration of PO faculty, as called for by the Pathways Commission, and to examine issues associated with the Pathways Commission's call for examining alternative pathways to terminal degrees. The study surveyed 267 current PO accounting faculty members in the U.S. regarding their experiences and perceptions of their roles in accounting departments. Overall results suggest that these faculty members are largely satisfied with their experiences in academia. Participants also indicated that the teaching-related training, feedback, and guidance they receive are quite limited; participation in service activities is moderate; and involvement in research activities is low. In line with the concerns expressed by the Pathways Commission, part-time PO faculty frequently have aspirations for full-time and/or tenure track positions, and they view the lack of a doctorate as impeding their chance of achieving those aspirations. The findings support four themes highlighted by the Pathways Commission: (a) increasing access to doctoral education; (b) improving teaching-related training, feedback, and guidance; (c) more effectively integrating PO faculty into accounting departments; and (d) engaging PO faculty in research activities."

Schaeffer",2015,"Journal of Accounting Education","2ebdad04-9ac8-3cd3-b272-d4ca4f837177","Core competencies Course redesign Depth vs breadth Learning technologies Retention","This article describes how one accounting program addressed declining retention rates and student performance issues with a focused course redesign of its introductory financial accounting course. The course redesign unites (a) the notion of promoting a thorough comprehension of “core competencies” rather than providing a cursory acquaintance with a broader variety of less critical ancillary topics; (b) an assortment of “continual review” techniques designed to maximize retaining the in-depth knowledge attained; and (c) utilization of a variety of stimulating and effectual technological enhancements to engage students and foster an active learning environment in the course. Anecdotal evidence gathered and limited empirical analysis suggests that the redesign endeavors have increased performance, enhanced student retention, and stimulated growth in the number of accounting majors relative to enrollment growth in the college of business. This approach, or any of several variants, can be adopted by other accounting programs to address similar issues. With many institutions currently facing declining enrollments and student retention along with accompanying financial consequences, our experience provides a timely potential remedy."

Wilner",2015,"Journal of Accounting Education","9a0c394b-b5df-3c27-bc48-cb68359e14c2","Assimilation learning theory Concept maps Cost systems Product cost","Accounting students often perceive their beginning cost or managerial course as lacking a framework with which they can organize the material. They have usually completed a beginning Financial Accounting course recently where the accounting equation provides such a framework. This makes the lack of a framework in their next course even more problematical. This paper provides a framework for integrating topics in the cost/managerial course to enhance learning. The framework uses hierarchical concept maps as the integrating mechanism. Concept maps provide a visual presentation method based on the theories of learning and knowledge. Assimilation learning theory posits that the difference between meaningful learning and rote learning depends upon whether or not the new information is integrated with, and connected to, existing knowledge. Meaningful learning takes place most easily when broader concepts are presented first and detailed ones that provide support are furnished later. Hierarchical concept maps are organized in such a fashion, with the more general, inclusive concepts at the top of the map, and progressively more specific concepts arranged below them. Concept maps are a way to develop logical thinking and study skills by revealing connections and helping students see how individual ideas form a larger whole. The paper provides a detailed discussion of how to proceed with the concept maps as building blocks in the course. This can help the instructor organize their presentation in a logical manner aimed at enhancing student learning. We also provide a comprehensive numerical example to reinforce the process over the course of the semester."

Popular press articles on these plans often present a myriad of details on the effects of inflation, rates of return, expected tax rates, ordinary income versus capital gains treatment, and other items that tend to obscure their fundamental tax advantages. The goal of this teaching note is to expose the fundamental tax advantages of retirement savings plans by conducting an analysis of a simplified tax setting. We identify four interrelated benefits of existing retirement plans – tax-deferred contributions, tax-deferred earnings, never-taxed earnings, and income smoothing with progressive tax rates. We also provide a more in-depth analysis of the choice between the two most popular forms of retirement savings, traditional and Roth accounts. An understanding of the properties of the tax benefits of retirement savings can be useful for students who are preparing for careers as tax professionals, as well as individuals who wish to understand the financial planning advice they receive."

Prior SRS studies both within accounting and other academic disciplines have found conflicting results as to its influence on student course performance. This quasi-experimental study re-examines the relationship between the use of an SRS and course performance. We also investigate how using SRS influences student confidence and time spent studying outside of class. Unlike prior SRS related studies, we tested both our SRS class and our control class (with no SRS) in the same academic semester with the same instructor to provide a higher degree of experimental control. Through doing so, we compared the benefit of immediate feedback achieved by SRS to the delayed feedback of traditional assessment formats. Higher in-class performance on multiple-choice quiz items was found for students using SRS versus those who did not use SRS; however, no significant differences in examination performance or overall course performance were noted between the two groups. Students using SRS reported being more confident in their abilities and spent less time preparing for the course outside of class, while maintaining similar overall course performance when compared to those who did not use the SRS. We conclude our study by providing areas of meaningful future research related to the use of SRS. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd."

We argue in this paper that the same concerns noted for accounting research in general are evident in accounting education research. A historical analysis of the literature shows that most published accounting education articles are not empirical, still relate to a few general topics, and ignore several issues that we believe are important to accounting education practice. Empirical articles generally rely on the survey research method, with relatively few studies using experimental (or even quasi-experimental) methods.

The Program, which has grown and evolved over the past 20. years, was founded on the purported benefits of experiential learning and calls dating back nearly three decades for curricular change designed to enhance the core competencies of accounting graduates. The internship is organized and run as an actual accounting practice in which the instructor serves as the Executive Partner and maintains professional liability insurance though the AICPA carrier. Students, working in teams ranging in size from three to seven, serve as the professional staff. The client base consists of not-for-profit organizations that vary in size and complexity. Services range from limited scope consulting engagements to operational and financial audits. As evidence of program quality, in 2011 the practice successfully completed an AICPA mandatory peer review for quality of accounting, auditing and attestation services performed by AICPA members in public practice. Additional assessment data in the form of student and employer feedback indicate that the Program is meeting its stated objectives.

However, managers cannot support a control environment they do not understand. This misunderstanding generates a perception gap between corporate managers and auditors concerning internal control responsibilities, which may extend to academia as well. This research examines the perceptions of accounting and management professors concerning the understanding of who is ultimately responsible for establishing and maintaining internal controls over financial reporting and finds a statistically significant difference of opinion between the two groups. A large number of management professors surveyed relegate this role to internal auditors instead of management. These findings indicate management professors may not be fully aware of the responsibilities placed on managers of publicly traded companies for internal controls over financial reporting by the Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) Act of 2002. The survey also finds a statistically significant difference in the perceptions of accounting and management professors concerning where the topic of internal controls should be taught and who is most qualified to teach internal controls to non-accounting business majors. This disconnect between management and accounting professors could potentially generate a business curriculum that leaves non-accounting business majors with little or no exposure to the roles and responsibilities of managers concerning internal controls over financial reporting. This research highlights the important role of accounting professors to help minimize this disconnect and provides specific recommendations to improve the exposure necessary for non-accounting business majors. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd."

The data indicate that only 31.4% of accounting's 4855 doctoral faculty who teach at schools in North America have one or more publications in these 13 journals. For those doctorates still teaching, the research provides rankings of authors by doctoral year and for four periods: 2002-2011 (most recent 10. years), 1992-2001 (next 10-year period), 1966-1991 (last 26. years), and for the entire 46-year period. To acknowledge the contributions of retired and deceased authors, the research lists those authors who would have been included on the overall list had they still been actively teaching. While Urbancic (2009) and Brigham Young University (BYU) provide rankings of authors in accounting education, these rankings are limited in the scope of the journals included - Urbancic includes only six accounting education journals, while BYU includes only Issues in Accounting Education. We found that Urbancic's (BYU's) 10-year (20-year) data had a Spearman's rho of -0.84 (0.39) with our rankings.

However, research indicates that most programs do not achieve outcomes in all three areas with Henscheid (2000) revealing that integration is the major goal of many capstone programs. As well, in the accounting education literature there has been little empirical evidence relating to the effectiveness of student learning as a result of implementing a capstone unit.This study reports on the development and implementation of an accountancy capstone unit at the Queensland University of Technology (QUT), which began in 2006. The main features of this capstone unit are: the use of problem-based learning (PBL); integration of the program; the development of a professional identity whereby classes are broken up into groups of a maximum of five students who take on the persona of a professional accounting firm for an entire semester; and the students, acting as professional advisors within that firm, are required to solve a series of unstructured, multi-dimensional accounting problems based on limited given facts. This process is similar to a professional advisor asking a client about the facts relating to the particular problem of the client and then solving the problem.The research was conducted over nine semesters and involved the collection of both quantitative and qualitative data from a student questionnaire. The results indicate that in terms of student perceptions, the capstone unit was very effective in enhancing integration of the program and enhancing professional identity thereby assisting student transition into the professional accounting workplace. Our approach therefore meets two of the three generally accepted aims of a capstone unit. With accounting educators striving to maximise student learning from a finite set of resources, this approach using PBL has resulted in improved learning outcomes for accounting students about to enter the workplace as professionals. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd."

The purpose of this instructional resource (IR) is to provide a thorough hands-on, active learning resource that will allow introductory students to experience a full set of accounting and management activities necessary to produce a job and assign production costs to it. For example, the IR requires students to analyze overhead costs, determine the optimal job size, schedule production, calculate the amount of materials to purchase, complete material requisitions, update raw materials records, analyze labor time records, complete a job cost record and address critical thinking questions. The IR was developed for use in a ""flipped classroom"" in which students work under the guidance of the instructor, but could alternatively be assigned as an unsupervised out-of-class assignment or on-line project. Since the IR was specifically developed as a learning tool for novice introductory managerial accounting students, adequate guidance is provided throughout the activity. However, to add realism and challenge students to think beyond the confines of simple mechanics, management and accounting issues are seeded throughout. Student feedback indicates that the IR not only helps students learn how a job costing system operates, but also helps students become aware of management decisions and accounting issues that impact the costs assigned to a job. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd."

At a mid-sized public university in the Western US many students enrolled in Intermediate Accounting I (their first upper-division course) struggle with the rigor and academic demands of this course, resulting in failure rates of 30-45%. In many cases, students new to upper-division courses appear to lack a commitment to, or awareness of, the effort needed for success in the accounting program. The faculty implemented an accounting ""Boot Camp"" to prepare new accounting majors for the expectations of the program. This paper details the implementation of the Boot Camp and reviews its effectiveness by comparing the performance of attendees with the performance of non-attendees. After controlling for other contributing factors, the evidence suggests that attendees outperform their non-attending peers in Intermediate Accounting I. This relatively low-cost intervention should be attractive to faculty concerned about the common problem of students failing and then retaking intermediate accounting. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd."

We also find that instructor rankings constructed from SET ratings vary with PCI. These findings suggest that, when heterogeneous perceptions are present, satisfying all students enrolled in a course may not be possible and that reliance on aggregated SET data may obscure important differences in student opinion. In this circumstance, disaggregating SET data by PCI and emphasizing the feedback of students holding higher (stronger) perceptions of course importance may enhance SET diagnostic value. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd."

One advanced topic that can be covered to enrich such courses is ""triggered events."" Triggered events are useful in implementing accounting processes, such as data validation, control and exception reporting in databases. To date, teaching triggered events required enterprise-level database systems, thereby making it difficult to replicate in an introductory class. However, data macro features introduced in the 2010 version of Microsoft Access can now be used to teach such concepts in an easy-to-use interface.

In particular, they struggle with the first stage of the double-entry process: identifying which accounts are to be debited and which are to be credited for each transaction. This paper reports on an attempt to overcome this situation by using the first printed instructional text on the subject (Pacioli, 1494) as the principal textbook on a 20-hour component of the introductory financial accounting course in an undergraduate accounting degree program. Instruction followed the pedagogy presented by Pacioli and only minimal additional costs to faculty were incurred.The innovation was successful. In their assessment, students not only demonstrated that they had learned, understood, and were able to draft the correct entries to make into the Journal, they did so correctly to an extent that exceeded expectations. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd."

Unsurprisingly, what emerged from this encounter was a common set of recurring themes: the crisis in public confidence; the complexity of the issues underlying this malaise; the challenge that these complexities represent for the continued legitimacy of the professions; and the various programmes of action being developed in response to these challenges. Most of the professional bodies were in the process of implementing a programme of action and one of the key motivations articulated for these programmes was to restore trust. Two broad types of response were apparent, firstly aspirational and secondly educational. Professional bodies need to be more than professional trade associations for the protection and furtherance of the interests of members. To foster a culture of the club will only continue to undermine the legitimacy of professional bodies and the public's trust in them."

Firstly, he suggested that globalisation has brought businesses into contact with many different codes of conduct, from the principles-based ethical code in the UK, to the US or continental model, based on rules. Secondly, however, he suggested that ethical pressures within the finance sector relate to lapses in individual ethical behaviour. He identified three factors which may influence the level of unethical behaviour: market pressure, executive stock options, and the increasing complexity of financial markets. He argued that stock options can create a conflict of interest as management are also in a position to inflate the value of a stock in the short term."

She suggested that the Nursing & Midwifery Council, as a regulatory body, was primarily responsible for establishing and maintaining the fitness to practice of those coming onto its register. Sarah argued the Nursing and Midwifery Council was experiencing pressures from two particular sources. Firstly, she suggested that some of the pressures were specific to the medical profession and related to cases like Shipman, Alder Hey and Bristol. She contended that the second source of pressure related to the emergence of a broader governance discourse, as seen for example in Nolan, Enron and the Better Regulation Task Force, that cuts across professional boundaries."

One of the recurring themes in her presentation was the word ""change"". On top of the complex structural issues facing the profession, Lewis suggested that the Pharmaceutical Society was going through a period of major change both in culture and practice. She identified four major influences behind these changes: scientific and technological developments; social and economic drivers; public expectations (in the sense that the public are more informed and educated) and policy changes."

Industrial Management","Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to examine the important issue of trust in senior management in the public sector. More specifically, the research aims to explore to what extent has there been a downward spiral of trust in public sector senior management in the eyes of their employees in recent years, and whether this trend spans the public sector as a whole. Design/methodology/approach – This paper draws on both quantitative and qualitative methodologies from two public sector organisations, which are of very different character. The question being asking of the data is whether a relatively similar percentage of the workforce lacks trust in senior management and whether this is for essentially the same reasons. An attitude survey of the population of both case study organisations was conducted in conjunction with focus groups. Findings – The findings in the paper revealed two important matters. First, longitudinal data indicates that relative distrust of senior management is enduring and cannot be explained or rationalised by merely a short-term breakdown of communication. The second conclusion from the data is that although the two case study organisations had dramatically different structural characteristics, histories and workforce compositions, the degree of lack of trust in senior management was remarkably similar both as regards extent and leading cause of this. Practical implications – The findings from two very different public sector organisations suggest that there is a persistent lack of trust in senior management. This finding has important implications for managing the workforce as a lack of trust has significant implications for employee attitudes and behaviour. Originality/value – This paper raises some important concerns with regards to the quality of the employee-employer relationship in the public sector."

From Gordon's perspective, ethical leadership is characterised by personal integrity, respect for others and the efficient and appropriate use of company resources. He contended that fellow employees, customers and service providers must all be treated with dignity yet he also argued that ethical leadership involves recognising employees skills and not placing people in situations where they are unable to cope with their responsibilities and temptations. He then suggested that there are two areas of ethical challenge in relation to entrepreneurship in particular. Firstly, in the relation to the business itself and secondly in relation to how the idea is brought to fruition."

He suggested that the application of specific medical ethical principles depends on the doctors perceived role and function as they engage with a specific challenge. Michael then drew on two problematic areas in particular: personal health information and the right to health, in order to elaborate on how the application of these principles necessitates a multidisciplinary approach. The issue of personal health information relates to the growth in information technology and the concomitant explosion in the quantity of personal information held on databases. Michael also referred to Article 12 of the International Convention on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights which asserts, ""The right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health."""

The key to understanding professional obligation is to understand what a profession is. Hooker gave an explanation of why you have professions. He used it as basis for a simple theory of professional obligation that seems to explain why obligations can differ across professions. He also derived some consequences for what it means to teach professional ethics. If the purpose of a profession is to enable you to expect a certain kind of conduct from its members, then professionals ought to live up to that expectation. This is what professional obligation is. It is the obligation to fulfill the expectations the profession has created and on which the public relies. The basis for this obligation is the duty to keep a promise."

Firstly, it is valuable because many of the ethical challenges facing different professional groups are similar in type, they are to do with things like the nature of professional relationships; the social function of the professions and broad socio-legal discourses on issues like human rights. Secondly, new policy agendas are forcing disparate professional and business groups together into new working relationships and this kind of interdisciplinary forum provides an opportunity to explore whether and how different kinds of values have become embedded in different modes of professional obligations and practices and also the extent to which these values conflict across the professions."

With a prolific research stream developing in the area of business ethics teaching, our understanding of related approaches and issues has deepened. While researchers focus on the holistic approach to teaching business ethics, specific knowledge about teaching methods in this area remains sparse. This paper discusses an innovative approach to the case method, called case development, and its preliminary assessment in a postgraduate marketing ethics course. Groups of students were asked to research a chosen marketing ethics topic, develop a case study as part of their assessment and to subsequently analyse and present it to the class. Based on an initial assessment by means of a student survey, case development emerged as beneficial in terms of student learning and experience. Following a discussion of the approach and related results, the paper concludes with recommendations and directions for future research. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]"

This is in accord with one possible overarching goal for business ethics education: to teach philosophy. In an academic setting, they ought not to be dealing with student behavior. They should not be telling them what to do and how they should live. Lori Verstegen Ryan of San Diego State University said that Management 356 is where she focuses her energy.

One of the most important lessons is the overcoming of some all-too-common dualisms found in everyday thinking. Among these are the strict confrontation of morality and self-interest, of ethics and economics, or of solidarity and competition. Unlike marketing, accounting, financial and management courses, a business ethics course is not typically requested by students or potential employers. Rather, it is required by society. Numerous unethical behaviors exist in the business world, and society expects business schools to address this by teaching their students ethics as well as the fundamentals of business management -- by nurturing and fostering their moral characters, so that these future business people will exhibit fewer unethical behaviors and earn public trust of the business sector. Sometimes people do the wrong thing because they are not aware of what is right. To help students improve their moral judgment, business ethics class should increase ethical awareness, teach ethics-related concepts, and improve ethical decision-making skills."

The purpose of this paper is to help overcome this difficulty by describing a pedagogy the author has used successfully to integrate Catholic social ethics into the business ethics course. The pedagogy utilizes the Model of Integrated Course Design, the Method of Shared Inquiry, and a model of moral behavior grounded in the student's worldview. This framework makes plausible a learning goal of increasing not only students' moral awareness and moral reasoning, but their moral motivation as well-a goal particularly appropriate to a Catholic management education.

Using the Ignatian (Jesuit, Catholic) methodologies of self-reflection and discernment, comments by 195 undergraduate and graduate students enrolled in an American university regarding the relationship between ethical attitudes and business conduct are examined before and after completing a business ethics course. Results suggest that ethics education can 1) raise students' ethical awareness, and 2) shift ethical attitudes in either positive or negative directions, thus supporting the existence of levels of ethical understanding that our learning model proposes. Methodological challenges for current and future evaluation of the effectiveness of ethics education, including enhancement of the generalizability of findings across international borders, are considered. Several implications for linking business ethics education with the conduct and climate of business practice are also discussed. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]"

This paper documents the case of marketing students who dramatised an ethics enquiry supposedly held under the auspices of a professional marketing association to investigate breaches in its code of professional conduct. Interpretive research, in the form of a cartoon test, was employed to examine the contribution of the educational drama activity to student perceptions of learning within a role-playing experientially-based marketing unit at an Australian University. Findings reveal that students preferred the hotseating exercise to conventional teaching methods in terms of enjoyment, ""real-life"" experience, new understandings of both marketing and ethics, and their motivation to learn more about marketing ethics implications for themselves, customers and the profession. Strategically, the convention was found to involve the students emotionally and intellectually with some intensity, while revealing that some students may be fearful of the drama or even over-stimulated by the sometimes tense and powerful environment. This pedagogical approach was also seen to be particularly suitable for instruction for the delicate, contentious and personal issues often raised by ethics."

An individual's PET represents the individual's vulnerability to situational factors, i.e., how little or much it takes for members of organizations to cross their proverbial line to act in a way they deem unethical. The PET reflects the interplay among the situation, the particular ethical issue, and the individual. Exploring the PET can help account for why some people are sometimes able to withstand substantial organizational pressures to behave in congruence with their ethical intentions, whereas others crumble in the face of apparently minimal situational forces. We hope that students' exposure to and subsequent reflection upon their PET, by means of the exercise we present, will foster the development of their moral courage. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]"

Students are asked to consider both financial and non-financial information when evaluating a client's account balances. The client is in the waste business where there are a number of market, regulatory, and political factors that may affect the valuation of different accounts. Students are also directed to consider the importance of non-financial information in the integrated audit mandated by PCAOB Standard 5 and in fraud detection. The case can help students learn to explicitly consider non-financial information and understand the significance of integrating such information with financial data. The case is suitable for use in undergraduate or graduate auditing and assurance courses. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

Individualised questions are, however, more likely to encourage deep approaches to learning, especially when feedback goes beyond correct/incorrect signals. Individualised questions discourage inappropriate shortcuts, such as peers copying solutions. However, individualisation places extra work on an instructor, particularly in large classes. The objective of the paper is to promote independent learning by describing an automated approach that allows instructors to deliver individualised questions to students with minimal effort. The approach also allows students, at their own discretion, to get individualised help and feedback. Instructors that use rules-based drill-and-practice problems as part of the learning repertoire should find many opportunities to use the approach described in this article. Crown Copyright ?? 2008."

Data regarding the background variables were gathered using a questionnaire and examination marks were used to as measures of academic performance. Results indicate a significant association among prior academic achievement, prior knowledge of accounting, and students' academic performance. Additionally, students' confidence in their skills and abilities, perceptions regarding the role of university in career development, positive prior experiences of learning accounting, and a desire to experience intellectual growth are all significant variables in explaining variation in first year academic performance. Interestingly, the opportunity provided by university to broaden one's horizons (motive) and a willingness to ask for help from lecturers (preparedness) were found to be negatively associated with performance. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Consistent with previous research, this study considers whether gender is related to students' approaches to learning over time and if there are differences between students majoring in accounting or business in their approaches to learning. The results of the study indicate that the case study intervention was successful in some respects. However, contrary to expectations, an overall statistically significant increase in students' surface approach to learning was found. Additionally, it is reported that changes in students' approaches to learning over time are not associated with gender or degree program.

Advances in Accounting Education, 7, 109-127.] in three important ways. First, we develop a dependent variable that is a composite score based on five prior journal perception studies. Second, our model considers different independent variables; audience, journal availability, inclusion in the Social Sciences Citation Index (an independent measure of quality), and the journal's submission fee. This combination of variables increases the model's explanatory power by 21% compared to Bean and Bernardi's average R2. Finally, the results of our model are more consistent with those of prior perception studies. We also apply the model to recent accounting faculty publications, which provides a comparative rating of more than 200 journals.

On the basis of this theoretical report, a hypothesis has been formulated about the sequence in which each of 38 competencies is expected to become important to the MA during his/her career. Results presented here show that practicing MAs see the same sequence of competencies during their careers as is presented in the theoretical framework, supporting Birkett's competency model. The results indicate that there may be three groups of competencies: basic, advanced, and highly advanced. It may be said that the basic competencies need to be present at graduation. The advanced competencies may need to be present some years after the start of the MAs career. The highly advanced skills may be needed for Chief Financial Officer (CFO) candidates. These results suggest that advanced and highly advanced competencies are those that could be taught in continuing professional education (CPE) programs, while university education programs should focus on developing basic competencies. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

We have developed a classroom game that incorporates the Institute of Management Accountants' (IMA's) Statement of Ethical Professional Practice, a newly revised model of ethical conduct. In this game, students identify how the IMA's standards and principles are either upheld or violated in mini-case scenarios from workplace settings. The game facilitates student reflective thinking - a learning process where an individual addresses a problem that has many reasonable solutions rather than just one answer. The approach was introduced in managerial and cost accounting courses and has been employed also in an intermediate accounting setting. Feedback suggests that the game holds student interest, fosters reflective thinking, and can be used across multiple courses. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd."

However, budget constraints at many universities are creating larger class sizes, thereby complicating the student-engagement process in two respects. First, it is difficult for professors to motivate students to prepare for class when the students perceive a small probability of being held individually accountable for reading assigned materials. Second, it becomes harder for professors to have one-on-one interactions with students during class as enrollments grow (Litke, 1995). This lack of interaction makes it more difficult to engage students in the learning process. This article describes a teaching approach, called the "" hot seat,"" that overcomes these challenges by motivating students to prepare for class and engage in the learning process during class.

Thus, there was a direct benefit to procrastination, which students had to weigh against potential drawbacks. With a sample size larger than those previously reported in the literature, we find that for both procrastination measures, task procrastination is associated with lower task performance.

Willits",2010,"Journal of Accounting Education","e605799d-2c37-3dc1-a920-9e32a12be52e","Accountants' general education Accounting curriculum Liberal learning","The appropriate curricular balance between general and accounting education has been long contested and needs resolving as evidence suggests the model used at most schools is broken. One suggested fix would devote more of the accounting curriculum to liberal arts courses to produce accountants who could, for example, think critically and communicate effectively. However, ample evidence indicates that classical "" liberal education"" scarcely exists today, and what is offered in its place is often counterproductive, at worst, or adds little value at best. This paper reviews the current state of liberal education and concludes that what is actually delivered today by many arts and sciences colleges does not achieve the claimed benefits of a liberal education. Thus it falls on accounting educators to structure courses in ways that will make them exercises in liberal learning. The paper also discusses several strategies for enhancing the value of the general education component of each student's education. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd."

This literature provides educators with an ability to model approaches and techniques to enhance their teaching. Largely absent from the literature, however, is any attempt to identify teaching attributes that impede the learning process. While it may be assumed that ""the opposite of best practices"" would constitute methods or behaviors to be avoided, very little evidence is available to support this view. Little is known, except anecdotally, about why and how behaviors other than those subsumed in ""best practices"" frameworks can produce unintended negative results. Generally absent from the literature as well are perspectives from exemplars; that is, award-winning educators. This paper responds to both of these voids and presents evidence of classroom behaviors to be avoided because of their perceived negative effect on student learning. Specifically, we report survey responses from a sample of 105 accounting educators who have been formally recognized for their teaching excellence. These teaching exemplars were asked to list, in their own words and in ranked order of importance, up to five responses to the following question: ""what behaviors would you counsel other accounting educators to avoid?"" We received 374 responses to this question. A content analysis of these responses suggests the following major factors (in decreasing order of importance): negative or uncaring attitudes about students and the class; improper preparation and organization; faulty or deficient course-delivery skills; assessment mistakes; and, inflexible/inaccessible demeanor. Our results should be relevant to accounting faculty interested in assessing and improving their own teaching as well as to senior faculty who are interested in mentoring junior faculty. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd."

However, many educational programs have not yet developed full curricula or integrated case studies in existing programs to compare and contrast how US GAAP and IFRS would record and present major accounting transactions.Based on events that reflect real world scenarios, this study presents a series of three Raleigh Building Products cases as an instrument to fill the current IFRS education void. The first case in the series discusses US GAAP acquisition and consolidation activities, the second case examines asset and intangible impairment under US GAAP and IFRS, and the last case adds components that differ significantly between US GAAP and IFRS. The series of cases can be used stand alone or build upon each other throughout the semester. The combined cases focus on the following key concepts: (1) calculating acquisition price; (2) preparing combination financial statements including deleting LIFO reserves; (3) measuring goodwill and other intangibles; (4) determining the impairment of goodwill due to economic declines; and (5) comparing fundamental differences between US GAAP to IFRS. The attached teaching notes detail these matters and discuss the statements of cash flows under US GAAP and IFRS.Results from classroom use indicate that this case will benefit accounting students and practitioners as IFRSs become effective in the US. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd."

However, textbooks do not consider all appropriate conceptual issues regarding the setting of the overhead application rate nor how these issues influence the causes of misapplied capacity costs (under/over-applied fixed manufacturing overhead) typically reported as the Production Volume Variance. Specifically, discussion is lacking related to those misapplied capacity costs potentially caused variously by the presence of capacity that is not explicitly planned to be used, capacity that is currently unused but in the longer-term is planned to be used (due to anticipated growth), and capacity that is currently unused but in the shorter term is planned to be used due to seasonality. Determining if any of these three causes are contributing to misapplied capacity costs is critical, as there are important managerial accounting and financial accounting reporting implications associated with each. And while the relevant literature to be discussed offers support for these causal constructs, this paper extends this literature by developing a parsimonious and conceptually-based approach to permit a simultaneous partitioning of misapplied capacity costs into these causal categories. Further, this paper will identify the important conceptual differences among these three causes, how these differences warrant unique approaches for the managerial and financial reporting of information related to capacity costs and utilization, and needed changes to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles to facilitate more appropriate financial reporting in this area. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd."

Few are as powerful or useful. Measurement and valuation issues are central to the study of accounting, and developing students' understanding of basic valuation concepts like the time value of money is critical. The purpose of this paper is to provide instructional resources to help build students' valuation skills by revealing the (1) power, (2) concepts, and (3) application of the time value of money and basic valuation concepts. Three tools are presented. The first reveals the evolution and impact of financial markets like the bond market and their requisite need for mathematics and the time value of money. The exercise uses a video accompanied with questions that are intended to act as a "" hook"" to capture student interest in lending and the time value of money. The second tool reveals concepts of bond financing, valuation and the time value of money. It begins with familiar time-value-of-money concepts and logically progresses. Each step uses intuition from prior steps to methodically build concepts in a discovery-learning process. The steps ignore bond terminology until the intuition between cash flows, interest rates, and purchase prices has been established. The third tool has students apply time-value-of-money and valuation concepts to plan and account for personal retirement assets. The exercise demonstrates the applicable usefulness and practical value of the time value of money and basic valuation skills. It can spark use of these concepts to empower fiscal responsibility and self-sufficiency. In sum, the article provides a small arsenal of exercises for delivering time value of money and valuation material. The exercises can be used collectively or individually depending on instructor preference and course parameters. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd."

Students study the basic concepts and potential benefits of interactive data and XBRL. Students learn to extract the financial reports of two companies in the same industry. Then, using traditional financial analysis techniques (ratio analysis) students can compare the performance of these companies. Thus, the project accomplishes two important objectives: it introduces students to the benefits and features of XBRL-tagged financial reporting and interactive data, and it shows how this medium can be used to facilitate the analysis of financial statements. The project uses free, publicly available interactive data tools to accomplish these objectives. This project is appropriate for any level of financial accounting course in which students use public company financial statements to generate financial ratios and conduct analysis on them. We aim the project at MBA-type introductory accounting courses. In addition, we show how it can easily be expanded to be applied to higher level financial statement analysis courses, both at the undergraduate and graduate levels. The project provides some background into how XBRL-tagged financial reporting is generated, while the main focus is on application of interactive data and not the technology itself. Since XBRL is now mandated by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for most reporting entities, it is critical for today's business students to be familiar with this method of communicating financial information. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd."

Rapid changes in information technology applications, both in accounting practice and in academe, have added to the complexity of accounting educator responsibilities. This paper reports on the development and use of a "" Virtual Office Hours"" (VOH) platform to enhance opportunities to engage students in their learning beyond the classroom environment. This approach has been developed as a result of instructor experience with adding technology applications in the accounting classroom to better reflect practice environment needs. VOH has been implemented in auditing and intermediate accounting courses to develop clear and assured lines of communication between the student and instructor, and to foster the use of information technologies as a normal and expected characteristic of the course learning environment. In so doing, the approach uses tools that students will likely apply in the practice setting to interact with clients and colleagues. This can be seen as an extension of the model conveyed by the AICPA in its Core Competency Framework to leverage technology for student skill building. Student feedback, insights from accounting course experiences with VOH, and suggestions on applicability to other accounting educators are considered in the paper. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd."

In such a world, the caliber of their ideas would be judged according to their ability to make a contribution to the knowledge of discipline. However, past research suggests that a prestige structure exists for doctoral programs such that a candidate's ability to be placed at a school is a function of his/her doctoral programs position in that hierarchy. In this world, limits exist upon possible placement for most candidates such that the caliber of their work will not be a determinative factor in their placement. Various divisions of the doctoral schools in accounting show that movement to higher groups is difficult for all groups. The higher-tier schools are more able to place their graduates in the same tier. Falls to lower tiers are especially likely for the graduates of the lower prestige groups of doctoral schools. This paper seeks to help participants in the labor market, doctoral candidates and those that hire them, obtain a more informed appreciation for their realistic prospects.

The impetus for this paper was the absence of current literature regarding curriculum, enrollment, and delivery of graduate tax programs in the United States, and it is the first study to compile information on MST program trends.A survey was mailed to MST program directors requesting information about enrollment, core courses, time to complete the degree, admission requirements, efforts required to maintain AACSB accreditation, faculty credentials, faculty compensation, and online instruction. We found that admission requirements, course scheduling, required and elective courses were consistent across MST programs, but enrollment numbers varied widely. Results show that programs often enroll students who received an undergraduate degree from their institution, although there was a consensus that students are unprepared for MST program study immediately upon receiving their undergraduate degree. There is substantial disagreement regarding online delivery of MST instruction, with most programs reacting negatively for pedagogical reasons. This survey represents the beginning of an annual effort to collect data from all MST programs and post data to a website (https://sites.google.com/a/mail.rmu.edu/mst/home).

Across a variety of education settings FA is one of the most effective classroom interventions for improving student learning outcomes. Yet the accounting education literature is almost devoid of any work related to FA. One barrier for developing FA in accounting education is the significant background knowledge needed to implement FA successfully. The purpose of this paper is to provide some of that background. The paper includes conceptual discussion from the general education literature to explain how FA improves learning and discussion of research that has identified features that affect the efficacy of FA practice. One of these features is how instructors use FA data to adjust instruction. An empirical study illustrates that accounting educators can use FA data to inform a decision about instructional sequencing. Instructional sequencing principles have been used to develop new accounting curricula and courses, and accounting education research has used empirical data to inform an instructional sequencing decision. The current study tests, using a sample of introductory accounting students, alternate versions of two FA tasks to determine which version is better for identifying deficiencies in student learning outcomes.

A mobile device can be a proprietary, vendor-specific remote, or a multi-purpose item such as a smartphone or computer. While SRSs have been used in education for some time, we perceive the adoption rate in accounting classes as still being quite low. This paper is a ""how to"" and ""why"" guide for accounting faculty who are considering using SRSs, and for experienced users who seek to refine or expand their SRS use. We briefly review key features of current technology choices, noting the wide range of functions and technology types that can facilitate both casual experimentation and more demanding uses. We then review and synthesize the related experimental literature on SRSs, and find clear evidence of student satisfaction and engagement, but evidence for only small improvements in learning and antecedent behaviors. We use the existing research on SRSs, combined with our collective 18. years of experience with this technology to provide an educator's ""how to"" for using an SRS in conjunction with teaching accounting. We cover such issues as how many questions to ask, when to ask them, how to grade them, sources of questions, and the issue of cheating.

Entities engaging in exchange transactions not denominated in their functional currency frequently enter into foreign currency forward contracts in order to mitigate their foreign exchange rate risk exposure. The aggregate effect on earnings of the transaction gain or loss on the foreign currency receivable and the gain or loss on the forward contract is known on the date the forward contract is initiated. The effect on each period's earnings during the term of a forward contract designated as a cash-flow hedge is also known on the date the contract is initiated; whereas the effect on each periods' earnings from a fair-value hedge cannot be determined until the respective balance sheet dates. Therefore, designating forward contracts as cash-flow hedges may suppress volatility in reported earnings compared to designating forward contracts as fair-value hedges. In addition, the reporting risk (the amount of uncertainty surrounding the pending measure of an item to be reported in the financial statements) is lower when a forward contract is designated as a cash-flow hedge relative to designating it as a fair-value hedge. This suggests foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash-flow hedges are more consistent with the purpose of hedge accounting: to mitigate the effects on earnings of applying different measurement criteria for the hedge and the hedged item. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd."

The IPLE described in this paper exposes students to a realistic practice environment within the classroom by bringing practitioners together with students in a professional supervisory setting. Practitioners review students' work and then meet with students one-on-one to provide feedback on their work. We also document evidence of the pedagogical value of an IPLE by using a between-subjects experimental design in which learning outcomes for participants are compared to a control group that received the same instructions and completed the same written assignment, but did not participate in the professional interaction. In addition, pre- and posttests of students' audit knowledge allowed for a within-subjects self-assessment of knowledge acquisition. The results strongly suggest that participation in the IPLE improves students' performance on a skills test of relevant audit material and increases their self-perceptions of knowledge gained. In addition, results indicate that both students and audit professionals consider the IPLE a positive professional learning experience. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd."

When determining the nature, timing and extent of substantive testing, the auditor must consider the costs involved in testing controls and compare that cost to the savings in substantive testing that can occur by relying on the tested controls. In other words, the auditor trades off control testing and substantive testing to determine the best mix of procedures. Similarly, for substantive evidence, the auditor must determine the best mix of substantive analytical procedures and tests of details. In this case, you will assess the trade-offs between the various types of auditing procedures (tests of controls, substantive analytical procedures and tests of details) to determine the optimal audit strategy. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd."

Fisher",2003,"Journal of Accounting Education","b5ea16ab-5f99-379b-aa8f-5c9fed54a1b4","Personality preferences","As the skills needed to succeed in accounting broaden, accounting programs must develop recruiting strategies to attract and retain individuals with a broader range of personality characteristics. As a form of recruitment evaluation, this study uses the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) to examine the characteristics of accounting students recruited into and retained by one of the original Accounting Education Change Commission (AECC) grant programs. Results indicate that, contrary to expectations, the personality types attracted to and retained in the program have not become more diverse over the course of 8 years. These results may imply that certain requisite preferences are needed to succeed in accounting or that homogeneity has benefits not previously considered. They certainly suggest a need to further refine recruiting processes, to focus on broader perceptions of the profession, to evaluate faculty's own preferences and biases and/or to develop curriculum to help students learn to utilize their less preferred personality traits. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Castellano Saul Young",2003,"Journal of Accounting Education","380f6139-c60f-30ad-b333-85cd90cef13b","Target costing","Target costing is an important strategic cost management topic. The competitive business environment requires firms to produce products with the quality and functionality demanded by customers while at the same time selling them for prices largely determined by the market. Conventional cost management and cost plus pricing strategies are not very effective in this new environment. The design-centered and market-driven focus of the target costing process and the inability of firms to trade off quality and functionality to achieve target costs, are concepts not always easy to demonstrate in an accounting exercise. To overcome this problem, the authors have developed an interactive, in-class, team-based target costing exercise. This problem involves students in the dynamic process required to bring a product to market that simultaneously meets customer requirements for quality, functionality, and price-cost, and the firm's target profit requirement. The authors describe and explain this exercise, and provide guidelines for conducting the exercise in class. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved."

Davis",2003,"Journal of Accounting Education","a58285ee-3dc9-30a0-a167-864b498b69b7","Classroom assessment technique Knowledge structure Pathfinder Structural assessment","Knowledge structure, or the way in which individuals organize knowledge, is a separate and distinct learning outcome. Extensive prior research supports the contention that knowledge structure is a primary determinant of expertise in any professional field. Assessments of structural development can provide instructors and students with unique feedback regarding progress toward the development of appropriate knowledge structure and the effectiveness of training, yet such assessments are seldom employed in accounting education. This paper presents a structural assessment technique, Pathfinder, which is easily implemented in an instructional setting to measure the development of students' structural knowledge. This paper describes Pathfinder and presents results from two studies conducted to evaluate the appropriateness of employing Pathfinder in accounting education. Results indicate that Pathfinder measures of structural assessment improved in response to instruction in accounting and pre-instructional differences in knowledge of accounting influenced the post-instructional quality of knowledge structure. Most importantly, data produced by Pathfinder enhanced the prediction of performance-related outcomes relevant to professional practice, beyond that provided by more traditional measures of student learning. Finally, knowledge structure measures were positively associated with domain-specific self-efficacy. Combined, these results confirm the convergent, discriminant and predictive validity of the measure and demonstrate that structural assessment can provide valuable feedback regarding instructional effectiveness. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

These include: (1) greater reinforcement and appreciation for the theoretical concepts underlying TVM analysis; (2) improved professional preparation for dealing with real-life TVM applications; and (3) a better backdrop from which to introduce more sophisticated TVM topics calling for a requisite mathematical understanding (e.g., effective interest rates and exponential growth between discrete interest periods). Comparative computational efficiency and learning effectiveness are empirically evaluated in an experiment on two groups of students: those who reinforced their learning using a mathematical approach and those who reinforced their learning using tables. Students that employed the mathematical approach scored significantly higher on a common achievement test and also completed the tests in significantly less time. A post-experimental attitudinal questionnaire revealed statistically significantly stronger student preferences for the mathematical approach. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

Mitchell",2003,"Journal of Accounting Education","c9963502-51d3-3928-8b9c-6da8d18855a3",NA,"Recent audit failures of unprecedented magnitude and their effects upon the capital markets have resulted in heightened public and regulatory concern towards the auditing profession. Increased scrutiny and a possible movement to principles-based accounting standards are creating an auditing environment in which ""critical thinking"" skills will be increasingly important. Consequently, rule based auditing courses may be insufficient to prepare students for the emerging discipline. Logic is an important component of ""critical thinking;"" in fact, the two are considered synonymous in the philosophy literature. Although logic has been called ""the mother discipline of auditing"" (Mautz & Sharaf, 1961. Philosophy of auditing. Sarasota, FL: American Accounting Association), training in logic is conspicuously absent from accounting curricula, while research in logic is almost non-existent in both the accounting education and audit judgment literatures. Students in this study were taught formal and informal logic in an auditing course. They studied valid and invalid argument forms within the specific context of auditing services. These students, others without training, and a sample of professional auditors were then tested with a series of real-world auditing vignettes requiring critical reasoning and judgment. Students trained in logic outperformed students without such training. Furthermore, students trained in logic outperformed experienced auditors in their abilities to discern valid versus invalid argument forms. Conversely, experienced auditors outperformed trained students in their abilities to discern believable versus less believable argument premises. The results of the study have important implications both for university education and for continuing professional education for auditors. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

This is unfortunate because owing to the extreme simplicity of the basic deterministic CVP model, students are better able to understand the elements added by generalizing the model to an uncertainty situation. A CVP model that incorporated uncertainty would therefore provide a good entry point into the important but complicated topic of decision-making under uncertainty. This paper sets forth, analyzes and applies a CVP under uncertainty model specifically geared toward classroom instruction. It is a simpler model than many of those developed in the research literature, but it does incorporate one advanced component: an ""economic"" demand function relating the expected sales level to price. Price is neither a constant nor a random variable in this model but rather the firm's basic decision variable. The simplicity of the model permits analytical solutions for five ""special prices"": (1) the highest price which sets breakeven probability equal to a minimum acceptable level; (2) the price which maximizes expected profits; (3) the price which maximizes a Cobb-Douglas utility function based on expected profits and breakeven probability; (4) the price which maximizes breakeven probability; and (5) the lowest price which sets breakeven probability equal to a minimum acceptable level. An example of application is presented in which the model is applied to pricing continuing education programs offered by Center for Management and Professional Development at the authors' university. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Using the team-learning model in a managerial accounting class: an experiment in cooperative learning. Issues in Accounting Education 16(4), 549-568; Ravenscroft, S., Buckless, F., Hassall, T., 1999. Cooperative learning - A literature guide. Accounting Education 8(2) (1999) 163-176]. Thus, two experiments were conducted (one using an experimental design and the other using a quasi-experimental design) that examined student performance and motivation to learn. The first experiment used a quasi-experimental design to compare the performance and motivation to learn of students who took a series of group quizzes versus students in comparable classes in a prior semester that did not take group quizzes. Using a series of group quizzes in a mixed factorial design, the second experiment examined the performance of both: (1) long-term groups versus ad hoc groups and (2) self-selected groups versus instructor assigned groups. Findings revealed no performance differences across conditions in either the first or second experiments. However, student subjects in the first experiment (using group quizzes) reported a significantly greater motivation to learn and perception of learning than those in the second experiment (not using group quizzes). ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The study also examines whether students' use of this knowledge depends on how subsequent test problems are structured. Results of a laboratory experiment indicate that the organization of topics affected how students structured their knowledge in memory. Further, when students subsequently solved test problems, recall of knowledge was superior on test problems that possessed a structure similar to students' memory structures and inferior on test problems that were not similar to their memory structures. No recall differences were detected when students solved problems that did not favor a particular structure. Implications of the results for course design and student assessment are discussed. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

The simulation requires students to assume the roles of top management and divisional management for Goliath Corporation in negotiating transfer prices. The student playing the role of top management first selects a transfer pricing policy from four possible mechanisms: market-based, cost-based, negotiated, and dual-pricing. Given the top manager's policy choice, divisional managers are then constrained to use that policy as they decide whether to purchase internally or externally based on their respective negotiations. In each negotiation, there is an ex ante best decision for Goliath as a whole. The case is thus useful in demonstrating how managers' transfer price policy choices can lead to bad sourcing decisions. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

Meta programmes provide an easily understood language that can facilitate an understanding on the part of accounting students and faculty, of metacognitive processes, an important pre-requisite to developing the skill of learning to learn. This paper reports the results of an interview-based study which identifies 11 meta programmes important to the specific context of students' educational experience. Meta programmes are found to affect the ability/inability of certain students to manage the educational process, a result that improves our understanding of why some students are better at coping with the demands of higher education than others. Since meta programmes are considered to operate at an unconscious or metacognitive level, raising awareness of their thinking and learning styles offers students the opportunity to influence, or change, their own cognitive processes involved in learning and therefore to enhance that learning. An increased understanding on the part of accounting faculty of their own and their students' meta programmes offers potential for improving communication with students and designing more effective teaching and feedback strategies. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Issues in Accounting Education, 21(2), 81-98.), the rejection rate for case/instructional resource submissions is relatively high. Why do such manuscripts get rejected for publication? To answer this question, we performed a content-analysis of the files of all case/instructional resource submissions (n = 156) that were rejected during the combined term of our editorships. A total of 342 ""primary"" and 156 ""secondary"" reasons for rejection were noted for this set of manuscripts. In decreasing order of importance, we find the following primary reasons for manuscript rejection: failure to provide evidence regarding the educational value of the case; case material judged not to be ""rich"" enough; failure to provide adequate implementation guidance (based on actual case usage); and, poor writing - specifically, incompleteness/lack of sufficient detail in the case itself. Weak/poorly constructed Teaching Notes stood out as the most important secondary reason for rejection of case submissions. These results were generally consistent between the two editors/time periods. To complement the quantitative results reported in the paper, we include selected quotes from reviewers and associate editors. These comments, and the related quantitative analysis, should be of interest to authors as they prepare cases and instructional resource papers for submission to accounting education journals. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Students apply virtue-based reasoning with reflective thinking to resolve conflicts faced by accounting professionals. Teaching techniques include class discussion, minute papers, reflection journals, role playing, and case analysis. Students express their thoughts orally and in written form, interact with other students, receive feedback during and after assignments, and demonstrate what they have learned. Reflective learning helps to transform existing ideas and understandings to come to a new understanding of a situation. As a tool for ethics education in accounting, reflective learning provides the link that may enhance ethical understanding and enable students to apply virtue and reflective thinking to a variety of situations discussed in accounting courses. For students, reflective learning slows down classroom activity giving them more time to process the material, linking it to prior ideas. Instructors benefit from frequent student feedback and greater involvement in the learning process. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

This paper addresses several objectives, the first of which is to describe organizational techniques that enable teams to function effectively. A framework for problem-solving commonly used in organizations that can be adapted for classroom use is then presented followed by a description of verbal analysis tools and an illustration of how each contributes to organizational decision making within the problem-solving framework. The paper concludes by providing insights into how these techniques can be integrated in taxation, information systems, audit, financial reporting, and management accounting courses. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

One group was provided an overview of the widely used Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO), Internal Control-Integrated Framework and the second group was provided a briefing on the Fraud Triangle, a model originally developed by criminologist, Donald R. Cressey (1973). As predicted, students who were provided an overview of the fraud triangle committed fewer Type I and Type II errors than students who were provided an overview of COSO.

This study evaluates the influence of cognitive moral development and a contextual factor, client risk level, on both ethical judgments and behavioral intentions. Results from a study of auditing students indicate that students with higher moral development evaluate earnings management as less ethical and are less likely to accept earnings management by an audit client than are students with lower moral development. Students in a high client risk scenario evaluated earnings management as less ethical and were also less likely to accept earnings management by an audit client than were students in a low client risk scenario. The results also show an interaction between client risk and moral development. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

A study of the job satisfaction of academic accountants. The Accounting Review (July), 46, 509-518). We also investigate whether job dissonance (dissatisfaction resulting from unmet needs) foreshadowed turnover of faculty respondents during the 2-year period following our survey. Results suggest that fulfillment for most job-related needs was lower for 1994 accounting educators than for their 1970 counterparts. Within the 1994 sample, certain perceptual differences were attributed to both race (black versus non-black) and gender. Regardless of demographics, however, reported job dissonance in 1994 was strongly associated with subsequent job turnover, particularly among assistant professors. Taking steps to reduce or eliminate job dissonance is arguably more important in today's environment than in 1994. Accounting faculty members today enjoy a greater number of opportunities and thus can more readily remove themselves from situations that create perceived job dissonance."

API's Board of Directors (BOD) must make important strategic planning and implementation decisions during a period of change. One Board member has suggested using performance measures to assess API's progress in implementing strategy and achieving goals. Students are asked to develop financial and nonfinancial measures relevant to API's strategy and to show how their suggested measures would appear in a balanced scorecard. Whether CPAs should be obligated to provide volunteer accounting services to the community is another issue that the case requires students to address."

Nevertheless, it has not previously been ascertained whether accounting students use their cognitive moral capability in the resolution of accounting-specific moral dilemmas. This study examines the cognitive moral capability, prescriptive reasoning, and deliberative reasoning of 110 accounting students enrolled in a cooperative accounting program. The results suggest that cooperative accounting students do not use their full cognitive moral capability in the resolution of accounting-specific moral dilemmas. In addition, associations between demographic variables and accounting students' cognitive moral capability reported in existing accounting ethics research do not appear to extend to cooperative accounting students' propensity to utilize principled moral considerations. This suggests the need for additional investigation of factors that may influence accounting students' propensity to use principled moral considerations in the resolution of accounting-specific moral dilemmas, and for further investigation into the effect of cooperative accounting education on accounting students' moral reasoning."

Significant differences (p=0.0001) are found between the models used to evaluate instructors in upper-level and lower-level accounting courses, instructors in cost/managerial and financial accounting courses, and even different instructors teaching the same course. The data are from the SET instrument used at a major state university, and cover a 6-year period. The findings imply that, in comparing and rewarding instructors based on summative evaluations, one needs to be aware of contingencies that affect students’ judgment models. Some of the differences in models are normatively appropriate, but personality or other extraneous environmental variables may inappropriately influence students’ judgment models of instructor effectiveness."

We believe that it is possible to make significant strides in improving curricula in this way. An example for a curriculum structure that includes a business core, an accounting core, and a specialization area in a master of accountancy degree is provided in the paper. Our suggested approach involves specifying goals for the educational program, followed by stating assessable objectives for program subsets.

Accounting Horizons, 10, 1–15 has shown that firms implementing the indirect method for reporting cash flows under SFAS 95 rarely produce financial statements that articulate cleanly. The purposes of this paper are (1) to provide financial accounting educators with a list of companies for which articulation does exist, (2) to describe the process by which educators can update the list in the future, or modify it to suit their own preferences, and (3) to present an analysis of firms’ reporting practices on the cash flow statement, which may be of interest to more advanced students studying the complexities of the statement of cash flows. This analysis of reporting practices involves an assessment of the articulation of individual COMPUSTAT line items (e.g. inventory) and subsets of line items (e.g. inventory, receivables, deferred taxes, and depreciation) for the 1998 data year. The findings indicate that relatively few firms report consistent values for single line items and that very few firms report consistent values across subsets of line items. Although the rate of articulation decreases as firm size, and hence reporting complexity, increases, 74 large, publicly-traded firms for which clean articulation does exist were identified. This list of firms should prove useful to introductory accounting educators who use real-world examples for classroom purposes."

Publications in 40 journals were used to measure faculty publication quantity. Journal ratings derived from a compilation of the rankings of five prior studies and co-authorship were used to measure publication quality. Choosing benchmarks for an individual faculty requires users of our data to determine four parameters: (1) what credit to give a faculty member for co-authored articles; (2) what level of journal quality is appropriate, e.g. presenting benchmarks for publications in the Best 4, Best 12, Best 22 and Best 40 journals; (3) choosing appropriate levels of performance, e.g. considering the publication record in the top 10%, top 20%, top 25%, top 33%, or top 50% of all faculty; and (4) deciding the emphasis to place on the number of years since the doctoral degree was earned. We believe that this is the first set of benchmarks that allows administrators to state, with some justification, a required number of articles for tenure or promotion. In addition, we discovered that the average number of authors per article is significantly correlated with time and growing at a pace of 0.017 authors per article per year."

The purpose of this study is to begin examining student perceptions regarding the first accounting course and how those perceptions relate to selection of accounting as a major. The study separately examines initial perceptions and changes in perceptions over the semester for intended accounting and non-accounting majors, and assesses the association of individual accounting instructors with changed student perceptions. We then examine the relationship between perceptual changes, final grades, and individual instructors on decisions to major in accounting. Responses from 331 introductory financial accounting students from two universities indicate that while intended accounting majors perceived the course more favorably than non-accounting majors at the beginning and end of the semester, both groups exhibited relatively positive attitudes toward the course. However, these attitudes were similarly less favorable by the end of the course for both groups. We also found evidence of the important role individual instructors play regarding changing student perceptions and selection of accounting as a major. The analyses for selection of accounting as a major indicate that the decision depended on initially intending to major in accounting, performance in the first course, and individual instructors, but not on changes in perception regarding the first course."

This means that coverage of the statement of cash flows is deferred until late in the introductory financial accounting course and related textbooks, a time when student motivation and retention may be waning. The timing of statement of cash flow coverage is unfortunate for two reasons. First, the statement of cash flows is an important topic that all business students need to understand. Second, most students understand cash flows at the start of their financial accounting class, so there is no reason to defer coverage of this topic. This paper describes a user-oriented, pedagogical approach to integrating the statement of cash flows throughout the first financial accounting course. The essence of this approach is the use of an expanded accounting equation with temporary cash accounts corresponding to the major categories on the statement of cash flows.

The approach involved giving students a range of choices in the areas of course content, methods of study, and modes and timing of assessment. The open learning approach required a heavy front-loaded investment for teachers in preparing resources. Results were, however, positive in many respects. For example, examination performance improved over immediately preceding years, and evidence of more effective student learning was found. There was also some recognition, by initially skeptical students, of the benefits of open learning, although the approach continued to be seen as alien and unconventional."

The cases are adapted from Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Releases, so they are based on real-world situations. Each case requires students to search accounting databases to find the appropriate pronouncements or other accounting guidance. Students must also synthesize the information to provide compelling arguments for their proposed solutions. The cases can help develop critical thinking skills in unstructured environments while reinforcing key financial accounting concepts. The Accounting Education Change Commission (AECC) states that accounting education should provide students with: 1. The ability to identify goals, problems and opportunities; 2. the ability to identify, gather, measure, summarize, verify, analyze, and interpret financial and nonfinancial data that are useful for addressing the goals, problems, and opportunities; and 3. the ability to use data, exercise judgments, evaluate risks, and solve real-world problems. (AECC, 1990, p. 308) The AECC report goes on to stress the importance of focusing on life-long learning skills rather than memorization. The cases presented here align well with these objectives. The use of real-world situations combined with the integration of database searches allow instructors to teach strategies for approaching difficult accounting situations that students can use throughout their accounting careers. A theme to many of the AECC grant school proposals was to increase the accounting research components of their programs and emphasize the case approach to accounting education (AECC, 1998). Several schools modified their existing programs by stressing applied accounting research, either by requiring a separate course or integrating the material into the intermediate accounting sequence. The University of Illinois provides a workshop to introduce research tools while Kansas State University and Rutgers University offer specific research courses. Others, such as Brigham Young University and the University of Chicago, interleave research tools with other course materials. The majority of the grant proposals also increased the use of cases in the programs to help students tackle unstructured decision environments. The cases presented here require students to do applied research to address unstructured, real-world accounting issues."

We model salary as a function of gender, years worked, achieved rank, quality of both the individual's doctoral granting and current institutions, and individual productivity, as measured by both the quantity and quality of journal articles published. We calculate the unique explanatory effect and the indirect effect of gender in the salary model, arguing that if gender displays significant explanatory power, discrimination in hiring practices and/or in the subsequent allocation of rewards may exist. Our study contributes to the research on compensation and salary inequities in that we utilize publicly available data collected from the budgets of a large sample of public institutions as our measure of salary, thus enhancing the objectivity of the dependent variable. Also, the determinants of salary (specifically, research publication quality) are captured in a more accurate and comprehensive fashion than in previous studies. In contrast to previous research findings, our results suggest that gender is not associated with systematic differences in the salary of accounting faculty. Both research productivity and work experience vary across gender. Therefore, since males, on average, had a greater number of publications and more seniority, their salaries were higher than those of female faculty members. The results suggest that discrimination against either gender is not pervasive in the salary structure of the accounting academic comunity."

Because of neuroplasticity, the brain’s ability to reconfigure throughout life in response to environmental influences, interaction with electronic devices affects brain structure and function. This paper explains how effective classroom teaching can accommodate changes in student learning styles and values. Students have a need-to-know, short-term, goal-oriented world view that contrasts with professors’ value of life-long learning for learning’s sake. Classroom processes developed for entrepreneurship classes that quickly engage and challenge students are effective and fun. Such processes are presented and examined here in the context of a workshop developed for faculty at the authors’ university."

Jaquette Jr.",2011,"journal of entrepreneurship education","ab0049e0-f211-348e-8b46-9dc8bf031985",NA,"Major business media outlets such as US News & World Report, BusinessWeek, Entrepreneur Media and Fortune Magazine now publish annual rankings of entrepreneurship efforts in universities and colleges. We argue that current ranking systems do not provide an accurate picture of entrepreneurship programs to their readers because the ranking metrics ignore a major nationwide trend - entrepreneurship education is becoming university-wide, featuring crossdisciplinary programs with diverse missions at each institution, rather than existing simply as a subspecialty in business or engineering programs. This creates at least two problems with the rankings: 1) accuracy of information, because of the difficulty of designating a single information source where there exists a complex set of programs and 2) inappropriate weighting of venture creation, which is less likely to be the primary focus for entrepreneurship programs that are university-wide. We recommend the field of entrepreneurship come up with a better information system (not a ranking system) for potential students and others who want to explore entrepreneurial offerings at universities. Such a system could and should be created to be 1) more substantive and informative, 2) centralized and 3) technologically appropriate, taking advantage of wiki technologies and the current Web 2.0 user-generated possibilities."

Entrepreneurship education has grown astronomically over the last thirty years. In fact, now the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts of America offer an “Entrepreneurship Badge” (Timmons, 2008). Though 11.8 percent of U.S. population is African American, they only own five percent of business firms in the U.S. Moreover, 90 percent of African-American owned firms have no paid employees. Yet between 1997 and 2002, of all groups, African American businesses experienced the highest growth rate, an astounding 45.4 percent (Ying, 2007). Recent growth has not been so strong. Therefore, it is imperative to understand the factors that influence career expectations and concerns of African American entrepreneurship students to ensure their continued economic growth and prosperity. A successful entrepreneurial landscape requires participation from all population sectors. The ethnic breakdown of the U. S. population has and will continue to become increasingly diverse; the contribution of minority business ownership makes a significant impact on the nation’s economy (Department of Labor,2009). This study investigated African American entrepreneurship students’ perceptions regarding (1) the level of importance of the factors that positively influenced their decisions to pursue an undergraduate degree in entrepreneurship, (2) the financial sources that support their undergraduate education, (3) the level of importance of the supportive elements that they expect will be important in their initial job assignments, and (4) their highest career expectations. Our findings would contribute to the efforts of the business schools and professional organizations in recruiting, retaining, and educating African American entrepreneurship students."

The variation of the exercise detailed focuses on relaying concepts relevant to entrepreneurship. The exercise can be used in undergraduate and MBA-level entrepreneurship courses. Specifically, student teams are tasked with developing new innovative “vehicles” that must meet target market value propositions. The project finale tasks students with dropping their vehicle, with raw egg in tow, from a second-story drop. The context of the exercise challenges students to “launch” their new venture in an emerging industry. Throughout the exercise, students are faced with a number of issues relevant to entrepreneurship. Concepts highlighted include customer value propositions, creativity, new venture team competencies, resource accumulation and management, bootstrapping, industry structures, competitive intelligence, and networking. This article details the exercise, provides instructions for employing it in the classroom, offers debriefing suggestions, and provides an illustration of the dominant product design. Results from surveys completed by both undergraduate and MBA students who completed the exercise suggest that desired teaching objectives are achieved and that the students perceive the exercise to be an innovative and engaging in-class project."

The sequence of steps did not follow the textbook model of a start up. Decisions were made with little information or analysis. The decision process reflects the entrepreneur’s lack of business experience and her sense of urgency. The founder went to familiar sources for referrals, help or information. Elected officials or government administrators were used to get help in cutting through local and state government state agencies Ms. Kiefer’s lack of experience in the restaurant industry was balanced by her nephew and his wife who had a formal education in restaurant operations and years of restaurant experience. On the other hand, Ms. Kiefer’s most valuable role was providing the investment funds and especially knowing people who could help solve problems. Hurricane Katrina had an impact on this process. The Warehouse District where The Creole Skillet is located suffered no flood or wind damage. Citywide damage, however, put a premium on getting skilled tradesmen for renovation work and getting proper permits, etc. through overworked City offices. Last, the convention business has been hurt, however, longterm prospects for the City, Warehouse District and The Creole Skillet are most optimistic."

This paper attempts to provide a framework for the teaching of opportunity identification. It argues that an understanding of the forces that shape opportunity can aid their identification. This is of particular importance to small entrepreneurs who do not have the resources of large companies to influence their environment. The paper begins by discerning between opportunity creation and discovery. Recognising the importance of non-market activity in creating opportunities, a discussion and example is provided of such activity. The issue of timing is explored through the concept of ‘thresholds’ when an environmental force reaches a point that sustains the existence of a business, and two models are introduced to illustrate these concepts. The first is a creativity/discovery spectrum which illustrates the difference between the two is dependent on the state of the environment and the work needed by the entrepreneur to bring the opportunity into existence. The second is an extension of the Product Life Cycle to provide a framework to explore dynamics behind opportunities, including growth stages, niche development, thresholds, the importance of timing and luck."

Although many researchers have analyzed textbooks, content analysis of textbooks from the aspect of entrepreneurial attitude has not yet been done and this article is groundbreaking in this field. In this research, all the literature textbooks such as reading and writing books of five grades at the elementary level in Iran that were published in 2010, was analyzed with qualitative content analysis method. In this analysis entrepreneurial attitude was broken down to five categories with referring to entrepreneurship literature models such as Robinson’s (1991). These categories are as follows: need for achievement, creativity and innovation, perceived selfcontrol, self-efficacy and opportunity recognition. Validity of the tool, were confirmed by some specialists and reliability were estimated by the pie-Scott coefficient over than 80%. The analysis of data gathered by content analysis, were done by descriptive and deductive statistic methods. Results show that in all reading textbooks, in sum total of text, question and picture, 24.8% of all units consider the entrepreneurial attitude. In writing textbooks, this percent is equal to 54.9%. In the subjects of reading book lessons, 22.15% of all attend to entrepreneurial attitude categories. Creativity and innovation, among the other categories, has the most frequency in all books and opportunity recognition has the least and there was a significant different in frequency of five categories. On the other hand, textbooks of third grade had the most and first grade textbooks had the least frequency. In attitude components, including affective one in reading books and behavioral one in writing books was significantly higher than the others. Cognitive component had the least scale in all books."

Over the past three years the University of La Verne’s College of Business and Public Management has been conducting a community outreach program for high school students. This paper represents a two year outcome assessment of a community outreach program that targeted first-generation, lowincome, and minority students from various Southern California School Districts intended to motivate students to seek college education in general and business education and entrepreneurship in particular. The outreach program was developed with a mission to overcome issues that usually restrict the college ambitions of the targeted population. Over the past two years (2007 and 2008), one hundred and eighteen high school juniors participated in a three-week business camp that introduced them to topics such as market and economics, success skills (including management, organization, creating an organization website, and presentations and job interviewing techniques), entrepreneurship, financial literacy, and business ethics. All classes were delivered by college professors and volunteer business and community leaders. Before the program, a combined 78% of participants indicated their willingness to go to college, while in the post assessment survey 96% indicated their desire to attend college. Only 2% indicated as “not sure” and 2% abstained due to illness. Additionally, on the post test, 50% indicated their desire to own a business in the future compared to 20% on the pre-test.

The entrepreneur’s recourse is to utilize a noncompete contract to protect the firm’s interests. In addition, entrepreneurs engaged in a franchise contract many times find themselves compelled to enter into a noncompete agreement with their franchisor. A buyer of an existing business also has a compelling interest in securing a noncompete agreement with the seller to ensure that the newly acquired business interest is protected from possible competing interests of the seller. The potential for economic harm as a result of the misappropriation of a business’s proprietary information by a former employee should be a part of the discussion in the entrepreneurship classroom. Students need to be exposed to this aspect of business development from an approach that does not overwhelm with too much legalese. The objective should be to impart an understanding of the critical importance noncompete agreements play in relation to the wellbeing of the enterprise."

This paper uses a case study to analyze the efforts of a faculty member to introduce a new form of active learning into the classroom experience. Active learning is defined as any strategy ""that involves students in doing things and thinking about the things they are doing” (Bonwell and Eison, 1991, p. 2). The introduction of active learning has become increasingly important to schools and colleges of business as they respond to criticisms about the lack of relevancy in the classroom (Bennis and O’Toole, 2005; Porter and McKibben ,1988; Lyman, 1997). A case study methodology is employed to describe the process used to help students gain a better understanding of the problems facing small business owners through the completion of micro consulting projects. Using field-based student consulting projects as a point of departure, an alternative to traditional field-based consulting projects is presented in the form of micro student consulting projects. Then, the results of a semester’s worth of projects are described that were completed by students at a small, public university in the Southeast. Among the benefits of the micro projects to the student are the confidence gained by selling their abilities as a consultant to a small business owner. The small business owners benefit from the analysis and recommendations that the students make. In addition, the students benefit from offering a professional opinion on a real business problem. We discuss how other instructors might entertain the option of having their students complete micro consulting projects. Then, we conclude by discussing possible directions for future research for faculty who use micro student projects as a form of active learning. 60 Journal of Entrepreneurship Education, Volume 11, 2008 This research provides a unique look into the process of conducting field-based student consulting projects at a school with little or no history of entrepreneurship education. Given the continued interest in entrepreneurship that exists, this study provides the reader with a template for creating and maintaining an alternative pedagogy for entrepreneurship education. More importantly, given the lack of formally trained entrepreneurship educators, this study provides a detailed assessment of the efforts of a faculty member to attempt an alternative pedagogy to help students grasp the challenges of small business management. While the specific objectives and milestones of any academic program are unique to that institution, this study may be used as a benchmark for the efforts of others to teach small business management at their own university or college, especially those institutions with limited resources."

Stanley John Boatwright",2008,"journal of entrepreneurship education","3248a8ba-ef6b-31f9-86f4-3f584b96beac",NA,"Entrepreneurship training requires a non-traditional approach in which students must learn to embrace the challenges of operating in a business environment that favors creativity and risktaking. Not only must students be exposed to a business education that emphasizes multi-disciplinary skills but they must participate in an “entrepreneurial experience”. This paper describes a student business organization’s project that provides for an “entrepreneurial experience”. The students applied course knowledge, exercised their analytical skills, learned to communicate effectively, utilized their negotiation skills, worked effectively in teams, complied with legal requirements, and utilized creative thought processes to solve business issues. The students experienced new business start-up issues such as writing marketing and business plans, obtaining a business loan, and applying for licenses and permits. The students experienced all aspects of business operations including writing a policy and procedures manual and human resource management manual. Through this “entrepreneurial experience” the students developed entrepreneurial competencies. The manuscript is of special interest to faculty that desire that their students have an actual “entrepreneurial experience”. The manuscript describes in detail the process of starting a studentrun business and continued operations of the business."

The 1997 study found that entrepreneurship was becoming a more accepted research area in marketing but was not yet well established within marketing departments. In fact, at the time of that study, more than 80 percent of schools offering entrepreneurship housed it in the management area. The current study shows that some progress has been made in entrepreneurship courses being offered by marketing departments, although there is room available for more progress. The results of this study also suggest that entrepreneurship has still not been fully embraced by the marketing discipline, as have areas such as channels management, consumer behavior, or marketing research. Our position is that many of the core issues of marketing such as value creation, satisfaction, and exchanges are facilitated when a firm acts more entrepreneurially."

Unfortunately, some students purposely cheat, and others lack sufficient competencies in research and writing, such that they violate academic integrity policies. While plagiarism has been a hot topic in recent media coverage, and in education at large, there is scant research in existence to date that addresses plagiarism specifically as it relates to business plans and entrepreneurship courses. Numerous researchers have observed an overall increase in various forms of academic dishonesty as well as shifting attitudes among students. This paper discusses business plan plagiarism cases and methods by which they were detected and prosecuted through the Judicial Affairs offices at one institution. The author also provides a possible impetus and suggestions for future research as it pertains to a growing challenge for the academic (and practical community)."

In fact, some researchers suggest that the U.S. is far ahead of other regions in terms of entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial education. This paper uses a case study to analyze the efforts of an individual hired to develop a comprehensive new entrepreneurship program at a school with little or no history of entrepreneurship education. Using a case study methodology, we describe the process used to build a comprehensive new program in entrepreneurship that will soon evolve reach 150 active entrepreneurial minors and the approval of a new major in entrepreneurship. We emphasize five issues that were central to the planning process that guided the creation of the program. These issues, described in the supporting literature were: what is taught, why it is taught, how it is taught, and how well it works (see Gorman and Hanlon, 1997; Vesper and Gartner, 1997; Solomon, Winslow and Tarabishy, 1998). To this list we add “leadership support.” This research provides a unique look into the process of creating a comprehensive, new program in entrepreneurship. Given the continued interest in entrepreneurship that exists, this study provides the reader with a template for creating and maintaining a comprehensive program in entrepreneurship. More importantly, given the lack of formally trained entrepreneurship educators, this study provides a detailed assessment of the foundation and creation of a program that has grown from literally nothing to a comprehensive academic program of study in five years. While the specific objectives and milestones of any academic program are unique to that institution, this study may be used as a benchmark for the efforts of others to create their own comprehensive entrepreneurship program for their university or college."

In this paper, we utilized a laboratory bargaining experiment to partially test nexus theory, focusing exclusively on the resource acquisition phase of the entrepreneurial process. As predicted, we found that several relevant personality traits improved profit performance on a resource acquisition game but only for subjects with previous task experience. Specifically, risk-taking propensity, locus of control, creativity, and social astuteness interacted with task experience to determine participants’ profits. Implications for entrepreneurial research and practice are discussed."

National content standards for entrepreneurship education have been developed that address content knowledge and attitudinal dispositions at elementary, middle, high school, and university levels. The current generation of students has even been referred to as the “Entrepreneurship Generation” (Kourilsky, 1995). In conjunction with this increased focus, one initiative that addressed the need for entrepreneurial and economic education at the elementary level was the Kentucky Council on Economic Education’s Entrepreneurs in Kentucky curriculum program. This initiative aimed to develop economic and entrepreneurial knowledge and positive attitudinal dispositions in elementary students. This paper presents the dispositional and content knowledge results of students from 13 elementary schools, a total of 300 students, who participated in the initial Entrepreneurs in Kentucky curriculum initiative. Student responses to the project’s pretest and posttest instrument were analyzed to examine if there was a significant difference between the mean pretest and posttest scores for student dispositions toward, and knowledge of, economic and entrepreneurial content. Results from the study indicate that there was a significant increase in elementary student knowledge and improvement in attitudinal dispositions related to economic and entrepreneurial concepts as a result of their participation in the elementary program."

This paper evaluates the effectiveness of MOB as a service-learning course in terms of the short-term effect on the personal and vocational development of urban youth and mentors and the effect on mentors’ learning. Key aspects of the service-learning course include a mentor training conference, the class experience and the field experience. Mentor, student and homeroom teacher surveys provide evidence of positive developmental changes occurring in MOB students. Academic records data indicate that the effect of the MOB program on students is favorable, as compared to the control group, in terms of reducing absences and tardiness to school. In addition, end-of-semester mentor surveys indicate that the experience had a positive effect on mentors’ vocational and community service plans. Finally, mentor reflections in end-of-semester journal entries provide evidence of a great learning experience and of a positive impact of MOB on their personal and vocational development."

Previous research was used to create the class, specifically Michael Morris' SEE model, and recent research was used again to evaluate the collaborative effort. The results expose advantages, disadvantages and future potential in interdisciplinary education efforts. Interdisciplinary teaching has impact on both the instructors and the students. In our experiential learning experience, the instructors, students and client benefited immensely by working in an interdisciplinary environment to create a workable business model and marketing plan. Such learning does not come without a price and the highest cost is instructor coordination. Instructors in an interdisciplinary experiential teaching situation must first recognize their common goals and then recognize that students and client will be active participants with how these goals are created, worked towards and hopefully achieved. As instructors of Entrepreneurship and Sport Marketing, we have five specific recommendations to make when creating an interdisciplinary experiential learning environment Our goal is to build upon research and present our experience as one more case study of what to do and what to avoid when creating an entrepreneurial interdisciplinary experiential learning environment."

Traditionally, in business schools, these tools included teaching students the functional areas such as finance, accounting and marketing. As increasing numbers of schools begin to add more experiential entrepreneurship courses, students may begin to see benefits beyond the traditional preparation, including increases in self-efficacy beliefs and performance outcomes. Bandura (1986) describes the four primary influences on self-efficacy beliefs as the following: accomplishing the task (mastery), seeing others succeed (modeling), getting encouragement (social persuasion) and changes in emotional states. Students who go though the process of new venture creation will possibly see an impact from at least three of these influences. This paper examines the possible impact of experiential entrepreneurship education on various types of self-efficacy and the effect on academic and business performance outcomes. Finally, a formal model of the described relationship is offered as well as testable propositions."

Popular academic textbooks used in college and university entrepreneurship courses seldom provide in-depth coverage of bootstrapping; many devote just a few paragraphs or pages to the subject. In sharp contrast to the coverage given in these textbooks, bootstrapping in its various forms has been advocated in, and documented by, the popular business press as a widespread phenomenon. Given that textbooks in any established discipline often draw heavily upon that discipline's existing body of literature, it is not surprising that a lack of formal research by members of the entrepreneurship scholarly community reflects the possibility that textbooks, and courses (if they are based on those textbooks), may be out-of-step with entrepreneurial reality."

The university undergraduate respondents were divided into those with high nascent entrepreneurial inclinations and those low in nascent entrepreneurial inclinations. A discriminate analysis between the three groups was then done and results were then and examined for similarities or differences with regards to life aspirations, life goals, and work goals of each group. Unlike the undergraduate respondents with low entrepreneurial potential, undergraduate respondents with high entrepreneurial potential were found to be very similar to actual entrepreneurs. Results of this research suggest that, when using students as proxies in the study of entrepreneurship, one needs to separate nascent from non-nascent students and use only those students who are high in nascent entrepreneurial inclinations."

Why? The aim of this article is to discuss critically entrepreneurship education, starting in contemporary European research on entrepreneurship. Earlier research defines entrepreneurship as a temporary process of innovation, only possible in capitalistic societies. In more recent research entrepreneurship is located within the entrepreneur, to a limited number of traits typical for the entrepreneurial personality despite its surroundings. Environmental or cultural factors are treated as either to promote or inhibit entrepreneurial behaviour/personality. The locus to specific traits of the individual is the logic behind the, normative and quite naïve, favouring of entrepreneurship education. Entrepreneurship education, characterised by learning by doing, practice-orientation, and so on, is viewed as the way to foster the right kind of individuals; individuals with the specific traits who form a kind of inner resources that can be profitable on the global market. In this perspective, entrepreneurship education seems to be a part of the ongoing neo liberal oriented restructuring process, which is sweeping through Europe, and the writings on entrepreneurship education can be understood as a specific political/ideological activity."

The terms entrepreneurship, small business management, and venture capitalism have been bandied about in the popular press and on television as virtually interchangeable. Perceptions of the attractiveness and activities associated with various employment fields may influence the career choices of students. Consequently, understanding how students view the differences in the meaning of these terms, as well as the similarities, will provide additional information for students to make better career decisions and allow business programs to adjust curricula to improve student outcomes. Small liberal arts institutions with strong business programs increasingly find enrollments often include more women than men. An additional trend is adults returning for advanced business degrees with dissimilar objectives from those obtaining their first business degree. The implications of student perceptions and interests in business areas such as entrepreneurship are relevant to institutions desiring to provide a quality business education with limited resources and changing demographics.

Students need to be inspired to possess an intention to start a business. Inspiration is an emotional issue which is essentially social. In this study, we establish the importance of the social context in generating emotions toward venture creation. We also propose important criteria for designing the social context in entrepreneurship education."

In contrast, research in the field pales relative to other areas of entrepreneurship. In order to reverse this problematic trend we first present a framework for academic entrepreneurship. Secondly, we conducted an extensive review of articles published in leading entrepreneurship journals from journal inception till the end of 2010 and compared the frequency of publication in academic entrepreneurship-related research to entrepreneurship research as a whole."

Specifically, two research questions were empirically investigated: Do social and institutional factors predict ECI among minority (Mexican-American) and non-minority (Caucasian) groups? and, Is there a significant difference in ECI between U.S.-born Mexican-American and Caucasian adults? The results of our data analyses of 170 graduating seniors in two large US universities indicate that social factors are significant predictors of ECI. Specifically, we found that perceived social status and perceived social support significantly predicted ECI among Mexican-American respondents. The findings also showed that the degree of ECI is significantly higher among Mexican-American respondents. Overall, the findings highlight the important role social factors play in fostering entrepreneurship and nascent behavior among Mexican-American Americans. This study contributes to the minority entrepreneurship literature by exploring entrepreneurial intention in general and social factors in particular."

In the case of knowledge-based work, such as product and service development (PSD), workspace can be considered an enabling and generative mechanism (Peponis et al. 2007); that is, it can be understood as an instrument for teaching entrepreneurship. We argue that workspace flexibility influences the way entrepreneurship students perceive their customer orientation. Using a sample of 62 participants from entrepreneurship courses, we analyzed how workspace flexibility can enhance the student’s ability to develop more customer-oriented products and services. Our findings show that workspace flexibility has a significantly positive effect on the perceived customer orientation. However, as our students work in entrepreneurial teams, we found that team size has no significant effect on the perceived customer orientation. Our study initially provides insights into analyzing the role of workspace in entrepreneurship education. Additionally, it suggests measures to assess workspace flexibility and customer orientation for future research. Keywords: customer orientation, workspace flexibility, entrepreneurship education, entrepreneurial teams"

To innovate new ways to meet these challenges, they will need an entrepreneurial orientation showing creativity, proactiveness and a willingness to take strategic risks. They will also need to work together in teams and negotiate with others in a global context. Entrepreneurship summer camp was designed to prepare students for these challenges by bringing together students from different countries for two-weeks of intensive study and collaborative work. Given the importance of sustainability for current and future generations, camp activities focused on the triple bottom line: people, planet and profit. This paper describes some of the activities included in the entrepreneurship summer camp and presents the results of students’ self-evaluations of their skills and how much they learned from the experience."

Students of entrepreneurship need to understand and appreciate the effect of sales growth on cash flow. This article illustrates the impact that sales growth has on the monthly and cumulative cash flow of the firm. A spreadsheet exercise is presented that allows students to observe alternative scenarios for a growing firm. By analyzing the effect of sales growth on the cash flow of the firm, students are impressed by the fact that sales growth must be financed and that exclusively focusing on revenue growth may allow the firm to literally grow itself into bankruptcy."

In Arkansas the SMG is distributed exclusively through the Arkansas Council on Economic Education [ACEE]. The Center for Economic Education and Students in Free Enterprises [SIFE] programs at Arkansas State University [CEE-ASU] have been using this simulation to introduce regular college students enrolled in economics courses and inservice-teachers to the stock market and the enterprise economy. The ASU SIFE team has been involved with the project in three ways. First the team has written two major publications and ten special activities' sheets distributed to students grades three through 12 participating in the program. The state had 1,200 teams in 1997-1998 alone. The second publication, entitled The News Cookbook Journal, presented the stock market in the framework of corporate activity and simulated a real company, which students could emulate in the classroom. This guide incorporates the role of the stock markets in with a simulation that can make real money for the class. This booklet was made available to teachers playing the stock market game throughout the state. The publisher of both guides is the Arkansas-Democrat Gazette. We also designed 10 special worksheets mailed to all participants of the SMG to enhance the learning portion of the exercise. SIFE wanted feedback on the effectiveness of the materials they produced. The SIFE team also helped conduct twenty teacher training workshops using their materials. SIFE team members served as host/hostess; conducted sessions; provided group checking stations, helped set up displays and provide some lecture for the teachers. A total of 417 teachers participated in these workshops. Finally SIFE team members set up play stations on the Internet version for students on the ASU Campus in formal class settings and informal student conferences providing additional services to students. The program was evaluated based on four goals: (1) increasing teacher and college student knowledge and appreciation for economics and the stock market, (2) affecting teacher attitudes toward economics, (3) increasing student knowledge and appreciation for economics and the stock market, grades 4 through 12 and (4) informing area teachers about the services available in teaching about the stock market through SIFE and the ASU Center for Economic Education. Using raw data, Chi-square and regression analysis techniques this program has been found to be successful, providing valuable insights that could help other instructors establish their economic education program."

The presentation covered different economic and finance concepts as the students sought a profitable solution to the energy deregulation in California. The SIFE students taught the high school students how electricity-producing windmills could increase farm and ranch income. Wind is a local and abundant commodity. A Kruskal-Wallis test is employed to compare pre and post exam results of the high school students. The results indicate a statistically significant increase in correct responses on the ex-post exam indicating that the SIFE students were able to teach challenging material."

But has the increased availability of entrepreneurial education actually had an impact on the entrepreneurial inclinations of graduates? This study examined whether entrepreneurship graduates from a mid-sized university currently own more businesses than other graduates. It also examined whether they have stronger intentions to open new businesses in the future. It was proposed that any such differences might be explained in terms of differing degrees of entrepreneurial and general self-efficacy. It was found that entrepreneurship majors have stronger intentions to open businesses within two to five years. However, the differences could not be explained in terms of either type of self-efficacy."

The first step in their campaign was to request that the Chancellor of the University proclaim the week of November 14th – 20th as Responsible Use of Credit Card Awareness Week at UNCE Pembroke. The Chancellor readily agreed to do this and commended the SIFE team for promoting money management skills among their fellow students. Once the team had the “blessing” from the Chancellor, it was able to receive help from University Relations to publicize the various events that were planned."

They are faced with the daily challenge of generating funds to support the growth and implementation of their programs. With the success in the U.S. and already in many global markets, entrepreneurship education organizations are dealing with the critical questions of what markets to serve, how and when to enter and grow, what programs and services to develop and offer, and how fast to grow. As they pursue growth they serve their mission and seek to maintain and improve the creativity, delivery, and quality of their programs. The markets they enter and strategies used can be expected to reflect the creativity and entrepreneurial spirit they offer and teach others. The article presents critical questions of where and how to enter and grow in global markets for entrepreneurship education organizations. It looks at unique factors influencing their motivation and interests to enter new markets. Essential factors and variables used in decision making are identified to assist the process of evaluating market potential and chances for success. Global market entry strategies are described with advantages and disadvantages. Once established in a new market, the challenges in developing and growing in the market are reviewed. The intent is to provide useful strategic questions, factors in decision making, and entry strategies suitable for most U.S. based entrepreneurship education organizations as they seek to serve needs and grow in global markets. The discussion focuses on the interests of private non-profit entrepreneurship education organizations."

Considerations of the study included whether lecturers perceived that students have the capacity to undertake a dissertation, the value and impact the dissertation may have upon student results, and the demands dissertation supervision places upon supervisors. Key findings are that the dissertation still has currency and offers transferable skills that may have value to employers. One emergent finding was to consider a ‘cut off’ point, in terms of previous academic performance, such that the dissertation route would be open only to the more able students."

The implicit learning objectives contained in producing research proposals are described and evaluated in terms of learning about research and research methodology. Particular consideration is given to the potential of research proposals to work in an educative sense as stand-alone entities quite separate from their role as a prelude to engaging in research activity. The benefits and limitations of using research proposals in separation from the actual experience of conducting empirical research are discussed. It is concluded that research proposals, used as stand-alone learning exercises, can prove particularly valuable where there might be concerns about gaining access to appropriate settings or getting ethical approval for practical research activity. They can also be of particular value in the context of courses where students' primary concern is with commissioning or evaluating research rather acquiring the skills to undertake research projects for themselves (e.g. MBA students)."

Agile is not only a subject domain in this work, the teaching method itself is based on Scrum, a popular agile methodology mostly used in software development projects. The method is supported by wikis, a natural platform for simulation of software development environments. The findings from the evaluation indicate that the method enables the creation of “significant learning”, which prepares students for life-long learning and increases their employability. However, the knowledge gains, resulting from wiki interactions are found to be more quantitative than qualitative. The results also imply that despite the active promotion of agile values of communication and feedback, issues regarding the teamwork are still emerging. The engagement of the teacher in the learning and teaching process was discovered to be a motivational factor for the team cohesion. This paper could be of interest to anyone planning to teach agile in the higher education settings, but also to a wider academic community interested in applying agile methods in their own teaching practice."

Specifically, three research questions were investigated: are there gaps in students' perception of service quality; are there gender differences in students' satisfaction; and what are the predictors of service quality and students' satisfaction? A survey instrument was completed by a random sample of 564 students from three universities in South Africa and Swaziland. The findings show that the students identify significant gaps between perceived importance of service quality and the actual experience with actual experience being lower. Significant gender differences were found in overall satisfaction. Moreover, results showed the most important predictors of overall students' satisfaction were intention to leave, trust in management, and perception of readiness for change. In addition to gender, cultural differences may also play a role students experience. Future research may also use a longitudinal approach to eliminate the limitations of a cross-sectional study.

It seeks to explore some issues which had previously lacked clarity; in particular, how formative feedback on academic literacy was used and acted upon, and if a Formative Feedback Intervention (FFI) increased the students' confidence in preparing for other summative assessments. It also considers whether the assignment of a grade was beneficial. As in earlier cycles, students were asked to give written reflections using Gibbs' reflective model (1988), and later via a semi-structured questionnaire, but in this cycle in-depth interviews were also carried out to provide rich data and the opportunity to ask follow-up questions. Findings show that feedback is shared with other students, and is transferred to other assignments. It is apparent that FFI has an emotional impact; the grade appears to be highly valued and although an element of competition exists, it appears to be used for self-motivation and monitoring of progress."

However, many needs assessment approaches rely on self-report attitudinal measures that are potentially plagued by self-presentation and social desirability biases. An alternative to self-reports are unobtrusive observations of actual behavior that reduce the potential for self-presentation. This paper presents a needs assessment framework describing how the trust game and the dictator game adopted from experimental economics can help measure discrimination, distinguish between stereotypes and prejudice, and determine appropriate diversity training methods accordingly. The purpose of this paper is to show how behavioral measures can complement attitudinal measures in the needs assessment process. The overall recommendation emanating from this paper is that diversity educators in business schools rely less on self-report measures and use more behavioral indicators in their attempts to design more effective diversity courses and programs."

This study uses a postal questionnaire to seek perceptions of accounting academics on the factors influencing them to include or exclude e-business related topics in UK and Irish undergraduate accounting degree programmes and to explore the likely future direction of e-business coverage in such degrees. Findings indicate that respondents generally felt that e-business is important and should be included in accounting degrees: both to reflect changes in the business environment and to increase the employability of graduates. However, the majority of respondents did not themselves teach any e-business topics to accounting students. While this could be attributed to a combination of factors, the most significant impediment to further emphasis on e-business was reported to be the lack of space in already crowded syllabi. Interestingly, lack of staff expertise or teaching materials were not considered to be major impediments. Although the focus of this study is the UK and Ireland, the empirical results have potential implications for the wider community of accounting educators by widening the international perspective on the issues addressed."

Building on psychological laboratory research, this study conceptualizes entrepreneurial mindsets along two different dimensions, elaborating and implemental mindsets. A study of 242 business school students shows a significant correlation between implemental entrepreneurial mindsets and the founding of new companies. However, elaborating entrepreneurial mindsets are unrelated to entrepreneurial activities. Further analysis shows that activation of elaborating entrepreneurial mindsets may actually disrupt the positive relationship between implemental entrepreneurial mindset and entrepreneurial activities. A possible explanation for this finding may be the different impacts of these types of mindsets on doubt and decisiveness of the subjects. While implementing mindsets are conducive to action, elaborating mindsets may induce more cognitive activity and doubt, increasing the threshold between intention and action. Implications for research and teaching are discussed."

This paper analyses the prior literature and evidence from a wide range of disciplines. A framework of five constructs and seven principles for constructive feedback interventions is then proposed. Finally the analysis concludes with the identification of guidelines for educationalists, managers and executive coaches on the application of the model."

The analysis shows that students play a number of different roles in these processes: as customer, actor, supplier, raw material and end product. The analysis also shows that instructors play a number of different roles in these self-same processes: as supplier, actor and customer. The paper concludes that viewing students as customers is overly simplistic. The paper suggests that students, instructors and support staff must accept that students play a multiplicity of roles, sometimes simultaneously, in university teaching and learning processes. The paper suggests that awareness among instructors of the different processes taking place and of the roles that students and instructors themselves play in those processes will improve the ability of universities to carry out their teaching and learning mission."

The objective of the exercise is to use a universal daily practice to illustrate issues in human behaviour and change management. Participants are tasked with advising the U.S. Mint on ways to promote greater use of dollar coins. It is presented in three parts each of which adds complexity and historical background. The exercise can be adapted to different class settings and formats depending on time frame and instructor preferences. The exercise is oriented towards courses in organisational behaviour, change management, and consulting but would also be useful in discussions on public policy and consumer behaviour. The case offers a contemporary and personal example of the challenges in promoting change at multiple levels."

Programs have responded by maintaining traditional face to face teaching, but increasing intensive and fully online offerings. In this research, students were asked why they chose a specific mode of learning, whether it met their expectations and the extent to which they learned. Traditional face to face learning appeared to be the preferred method of learning. Intensive and online learning was used to balance work and lifestyle pressures and/or to deal with geography. While learning style had some influence, most learners, felt they would learn more in a traditional format. Learners selecting intensive mode appeared to be more focussed on balancing work and lifestyle needs with their education and appeared less concerned about learning benefits. Learners selecting the fully online option appeared to be challenged by online interactivity and suggested preference for a more traditional face to face experience, even though the overall findings suggest they reported the most amount of learning. Understanding the reasons why specific modes of study are selected is important when making for academic programming decisions as courses move to more flexible delivery modes."

Yet the teaching and learning of this subject is often not smooth particularly for less numerical students. The conventional teaching approach, typified by students passively receiving statistical knowledge taught through the use of made-up data, has been discussed in previous statistics education research, and a number of revised approaches including problem-based learning, experiential learning, graphics and simulation, and understanding of students' previous statistical knowledge, have been put forward, all of which have the overriding aim at improving learning in statistics.  All of these revised approaches have successfully shown the benefits of their focus on the depth of learning. However, these benefits do not come without costs, as most of them sacrifice the breadth of what students should effectively learn. What's more, it is apparent that none of these approaches nurture an environment encouraging students to integrate the statistical concepts they learn.  To achieve improved learning in statistics, this study argues that deep learning constitutes only one facet of learning – breadth and integration being the others. Students should also have the right to learn the whole breadth of statistical knowledge as it was with the conventional teaching approach. They should also be given a learning setting within which they could engage in integrative learning.  This paper concentrates on the pilot trial of a new teaching approach that aims at achieving the triple effects of depth, breadth, and integration in student learning of statistics. It will give an account of the theoretical underpinning, the procedures taken, and the evidence collected for the new approach with the potential to achieve these three effects. As the pilot trial has such an ambitious aim, it is likely there may be some further room to fine tune the new teaching approach. The author does not claim that the new approach introduced in this paper is an optimal solution for teaching statistics. Instead, the new teaching approach, after having achieved a successful pilot trial outcome, should be positioned as an approach showing signs of improvement compared to the existing ones."

Too little attention is afforded to promoting the skills of analysis and critical thinking or the mastery of theories, abstract conception or a wider appreciation of moral principles. Our contribution deepens the debate about the purpose of business schools by creating a typology of ‘types’ of Business School Graduates (BSGs). We suggest that, as well as influencing the future of their graduates, business schools should be responsible for what ‘type’ of BSG they produce. Our typology offers four types – the Replacer, the Effectiveness Increaser, the World Improver and the Reflectionist. We propose that in future business schools should place emphasis on providing a wider education balancing human, environmental and economic perspectives. More credence must be given to the latter two types of BSG as opposed to the first two, who are the favoured choices of today."

This paper describes the objectives and process for using a “chess simulation”, an experiential learning method, that some faculty may consider using to help introduce or illustrate important management concepts to their students. This simulation requires numerous levels of involvement from students (e.g. planning and analysis, discussion and negotiation, teaching and learning, seeing and touching, feedback and application), and, thus, may provide an enduring lesson to participants. The simulation objectives and debrief points correlate the activities that the students experience during the chess match to specific management principles. As the simulation unfolds students will apply most of these principles, and, during the debrief, students will discover that they had been utilizing management principles in the game, and, thus, had gained experience in the application of these principals. To sum, I have found that the chess simulation has proven to be an effective and enjoyable method for illustrating and reinforcing management concepts in the classroom."

One UK university, responding to calls for innovation in postgraduate education, made the decision to use a different approach to teaching and learning on their part time MBA by introducing action learning into the final year research methodology and dissertation module. This paper reports the outcome of that decision, focussing on the student experience in learning sets. Data was captured by means of a semi-structured questionnaire and the findings were thematically analysed. Insights are offered into aspects of learning set psychological dynamics such as psychological climate, the emergence of hierarchy in learning sets and the inevitable leadership struggles that follow, all of which have an impact on both student satisfaction and effectiveness of the learning set. The paper also offers insights into action learning as both a teaching and learning methodology in the area of postgraduate study as experienced by the participants themselves."

In this study two sets of respondents were asked to reflect on the adoption process, using Rogers' (2003) diffusion of innovation model (with modifications) to frame both the questions and responses. Despite TBL's relative advantages, the results show a crucial factor affecting adoption of TBL is its compatibility with the would-be adopter's teaching approach and with the dominant organisational culture; other factors are TBL's visibility, trialability, and complexity. In the ensuing discussion, strategies for addressing the apparent chasm between the mainstream majority and early adopters of innovation are outlined."

Engagement, realism and handling complexity are important issues in Operations Management teaching, learning and assessment. It is argued that traditional text based case studies do not address these concerns sufficiently and consequently can encourage surface learning approaches. Consultancy and simulation are more likely to be effective on these issues with the greater focus on experiential learning. However the constraints of these techniques restrict use as assessment options, particularly for large undergraduate programmes.  This paper offers tutors of Operations Management an alternative approach to facilitating experiential learning using a multimedia case. The action research reported here develops this multimedia approach, identifies the practical considerations and the potential for improved student learning outcomes. The findings indicate that this multimedia approach was engaging, realistic and challenging hence facilitated greater student interest, understanding and skills."

In this paper, the intentions of first year students in a Business School of a traditional English University are examined. The Theory of Planned Behaviour is employed to develop a conceptual framework that focuses upon student identity and group norms as contributors to the subjective norm for the attendance intention of students. Factor analysis is used to analyse questionnaire responses and to identify thematic clusters of issues which influence student intention to attend. The findings suggest students do derive a sense of professional identity by attending a class, which is desirable, but that the intention to attend is also shaped by the tutor's use of group teaching methods, the management of expectations of class attendance in general and that students' can maintain a view of professionalism in their discipline which does not necessarily equate with the need for physical attendance."

The preferred ‘types’ align with recent literature in the area of employability skills and historical research on managerial competencies. Desired competency profiles did not differ significantly across a range of background and demographic characteristics or business activity/work area variables, implying employer perceptions on competencies do not vary with context.

Success in identifying personality patterns that distinguish between students enrolled in different business majors could help to develop personality profiles that might be used to assist undecided students in their choice of a business major and to provide information to decided ones regarding the value of their choice. However, before these profiles can be used with confidence, more research on the relationship between personality and choice of business majors should be conducted (Borges &amp; Osmon, 2001). The present study aims to further this knowledge. A sample of 109 university students enrolled in a compulsory undergraduate business course completed an online questionnaire. The results of the multiple hierarchical logistic regression analyses showed that gender and personality (neuroticism, openness to experience, agreeableness, and conscientiousness) account for 42.2% of the variance in business majors’ choice, while controlling for gender. Results are discussed in light of their implications in choice of business major and academic success."

This paper focuses on authenticity within the context of research informed teaching, which involves a basic relationship between teaching and research as the interdependent core activities in higher education. This study investigates how authentic learning may be used to enhance students’ research skills, and reports on a project which aimed to develop the research skills of international maritime business students enrolled on Maritime Business Masters awards at Plymouth. A teaching strategy designed to expose students via field visits and visiting speakers, to practical business contexts significantly enhanced their research skills. As an empirical study, this work contributes to the understanding of authenticity in higher education and confirms the importance of research informed teaching. Findings will be of interest to many programmes which seek to develop the research skills of postgraduate international students in management."

Previous studies claim that students should have an opportunity to engage themselves with practising researchers and a community of peers, experts, and others. However, earlier research demonstrates disciplinary differences among learning environments and the students' opportunities to engage with the scientific community. This paper draws on the experiences of three small groups of doctoral students in order to illuminate the importance of communities of practice in doctoral education in terms of students' perceived experiences of doctoral study. The study is set in the context of industrial engineering and management. A qualitative methodology was used to explore students' experiences of participating in small groups and ways in which this participation has contributed to their doctoral studies. An inductive protocol was used to analyse the data gathered through thematic interviews (N = 10). The findings of this study suggest that communities of practice can have a positive effect on doctoral students' doctoral experience, and therefore support their doctoral studies. The results suggest that some students need help from faculties and departments in order to develop peer connections."

The most powerful resource universities have to stimulate entrepreneurship is their students. However, there is no evaluated theory on how to encourage students to become entrepreneurs. Through three case studies the entrepreneurial encouragement offerings applied at MIT in the United States, IIIT in India, and Utrecht University in the Netherlands are investigated. The offerings provided by these institutes have been surveyed, interviews about these offerings with university staff have been performed, and reflected upon through interviews with entrepreneurs that graduated from these institutes. The three case studies provide insight in how student entrepreneurship encouragement offerings contributed to students choosing a career as an entrepreneur. Several successful examples of student entrepreneurship encouragement offerings are presented, and a model is proposed on how to effectively encourage entrepreneurship among students. The model supports academic institutes in constructing an environment that encourages student entrepreneurship and aims to help universities convince students to continue their careers as entrepreneurs."

The research informs educators making decisions about the use of simulations as to the value of considering critical thinking dispositions. Previous research has found that simulations are an effective way for students to engage actively in learning, bridging the gap between theory and practice. It has also been found that such simulations can develop students' critical thinking skills. However, hitherto no research has been undertaken into the role that existing critical thinking disposition has on the learning of students, as measured by the degree to which students perceived that they met the module's intended learning outcomes. This research offers insights into the role and importance of critical thinking disposition and its component dimensions and how this impacts student learning. The results indicate that the level of critical thinking disposition is positively related to the students' learning. The implications of the research suggest educators should target business simulations at specific cohorts of students. The relative importance of the critical thinking disposition constructs and the practical educational implications of these findings are discussed."

As a result, universities, and business schools in particular, are redesigning curricula to be responsive to marketplace demands. Curricula are increasingly using holistic and experiential learning tools to foster student satisfaction and career confidence. To connect these practices to the outcomes of satisfaction and confidence, we examined student responses to a newly designed, experiential undergraduate business curriculum. The results indicated that, compared to students who graduated from a traditional, functionally structured curriculum, students graduating from the holistic, experiential curriculum were significantly higher in their satisfaction and career self-efficacy (but not leader self-efficacy). These findings provide evidence that holistic, experiential curricular redesign is related to improved student attitudes and confidence. We conclude by discussing the implications for education and future research."

From the 35 surveys and 8 interviews conducted with educators who use business-related simulations, it is apparent that the majority are applying creative assessment practices and that most follow authentic assessment principles – whether they use this terminology or not – including offering students developmental (formative) assessment opportunities over the course of the simulation, explaining assessment criteria and ways that students can improve their performance, requiring students to undertake reflection on their learning and outcomes, and ensuring that higher order thinking skills are engaged. Findings also show considerable similarities in where students are performing less well and in tutor perceptions of the reasons why. The research provides ideas for simulation educators to develop their assessment as well as a basis for future research into simulation assessment and ways to improve student outcomes."

Entrepreneurship can be fostered by inculcating entrepreneurial skills right at the stage of education. The presence of Entrepreneurship Development Cell (EDC) in educational institutes helps in developing entrepreneurial culture in academic institutions so as to foster growth of innovation and entrepreneurship. With this premise a study was conducted on 1254 students of government and private institutes pursuing post graduation in Commerce, Science and Humanities with/without exposure to EDC in the national capital region of India. The results of the present study show that the students exposed to the activities of EDC are significantly higher on Innovation as compared to the students who do not get any such exposure. Also results shows that even the students of courses like science and humanities (these courses do not include business subjects) in private institutes are higher on Frequency of Entrepreneurial Activities where they are exposed to Entrepreneurial Development Cells."

Business schools have responded by embedding experiential learning opportunities, ranging from work placements to live client projects, throughout curriculum. This case study synthesizes research and theory from education and psychology to conceptualize how experiential learning in management education facilitates emotional engagement and learning. We proceed to pilot a conceptual model through a content analysis of reflective journals from an experiential course at an undergraduate business school. This case study suggests that student-goal orientation plays an important role in predicting emotional response, regulation and, ultimately, performance within an experiential learning environment. In addition, this study identifies that interdependency inherent within team-based experiential learning is a critical trigger of negative emotions. This suggests that the educational value of experiential learning is focused on how students learn to regulate and adapt to negative emotions, while maintaining a focus on performance."

Dialogue is a practice grounded in a pluralist framework that acknowledges the differing and sometimes conflicting opinions that arise among people with diverse backgrounds and experiences and provides tools to develop an awareness and understanding of these differences. It differs from other classroom practices such as discussion or debate because, unlike those practices, the purpose of dialogue is not to convince or win but to gain deeper understandings of each other. We describe the practice of dialogue as it occurs within a particular context that is created by both structure (for example, how chairs are arranged) and process (for example, how the interactions among seminar participants are conducted). Teaching a course using dialogue goes beyond simple technique to questioning the assumptions that underlie many student–faculty relationships. We reflect on the challenges inherent in introducing a new way of engaging among faculty and students."

As more methods become available to engage students in experiential learning, examining the impacts of these methodologies becomes even more important. The authors sought to expand the literature by examining how various instructional methodologies may be associated with student learning in a business capstone course. This study examines the relationship between simulation and case instructional methodologies with a rarely-used outcome in the related literature, a standardized assessment of all disciplines related to the business field. Data were collected on demographics, academic performance, and instructional methodology for 1049 undergraduate students from 83 sections of the capstone strategy course from Fall 2006 to Summer 2013. The results show that the instructional methodology utilized in the course was related to scores on the standardized assessment, with the case methodology being associated with higher scores. Computer simulations were not associated with scores significantly different from sections with no experiential exercise. The implications of these findings are discussed, along with potential methods for educators using these methodologies and avenues for future research."

The approach was designed and tested during a Higher National Diploma (HND) entrepreneurship module in a British HEI. Traditional taught sessions were blended with applied activities that required students to utilize the skills they learned to complete steps of the activities, which increased in length and complexity. Results found both a high level of student satisfaction and engagement and the belief that the module's experiential approach had, in many instances, helped to develop entrepreneurial traits. Successful practice and modifications are discussed."

The high quality of education in innovative fields provides a great opportunity for the establishment of new entrepreneurship. Through entrepreneurship education, young people, learn organizational skills, including time management, leadership development and interpersonal skills. Often the young entrepreneur faces barrier that influences and prevents the completion of the implementation. The current paper concerns the study of students' entrepreneurship activity and how this affected by various barriers and success factors. The survey was conducted among 169 students of University of Thessaly that attended entrepreneurship education program. The questionnaire that was used was based on the adapted instrument of Karhunen, Ledyaeva, Gustafsson-Pesonen, Mochnikova, and Vasilenko (2008). The questionnaire consisted of four groups of questions. All questions were answered with the use of a 5 point Likert type scale. Paired samples tests indicated significant differences before and after attending entrepreneurship class in both extrinsic and intrinsic barriers and also in success factors rates and future carrier plans. Despite these obstacles, however, encouraging students can be a way to overcome these obstacles and get into the business in the path of growth and innovation."

University–industry interaction","The purpose of this paper is to position and appraise the University of Bedfordshire Business School's initiative – ‘Practice Weeks’ – as a potentially innovative response to the current criticisms facing Management Education (ME). Criticisms of ME, we argue, are founded on the ‘irrelevancy’ debate, which is conceptualised in the first half of our literature review. The second half of the literature review examines Association of Business Schools (ABS) reports and reviews how business schools are responding to these critiques, reliant primarily on the tried and tested experiential learning models to do so. Building on these, ‘Practice Weeks’ are then presented as a case example from the University of Bedfordshire Business School (UBBS) as an innovative response to surfaced criticisms. Data is drawn from interviews carried out with students and employers who have participated in UBBS Practice Weeks, supported by quantitative insights from student survey questionnaires. Findings evidence that Practice Weeks have the potential to go further than existing experiential learning models to deliver practice-based education to business school students, whilst also capturing an effective and efficient approach to supporting business and community organisations in meeting their objectives."

As such it is an ideal method to both study the practices that entrepreneurship educators engage in and the discursive and cognitive shifts that learners go through as they seek a more entrepreneurial understanding. The paper suggests that the flexibility and rigorous nature of ethnography provides an appropriate tool for evaluating entrepreneurship teaching in educational institutions. Entrepreneurship is a practice that has always been of significance to economic development and is increasingly playing an important part in many aspects of 21st century life. While the discourses that surround entrepreneurship have been widely contested they have nevertheless seduced many nation states into searching for new ways to encourage and sustain economic growth. These discourses are evident in policies that use rhetoric about creating more entrepreneurs through explicitly encouraging entrepreneurial behavior by teaching entrepreneurship to students at all levels of education. The introduction of entrepreneurship education into Higher Education discourses can be traced throughout the western world over the last two decades. Whether talking about starting businesses, often the focus for American universities, or encouraging enterprising behavior, the terms used in the UK and some parts of Europe, entrepreneurship education has, using models from cognitive psychology and social cognition theories from education gradually become established as a discipline in Higher Education. As educational anthropologists we are interested in exploring the parameters of this new discipline. We propose that the nature of this discipline lends itself to ethnography as a method for discussions about how enterprising behavior is nurtured, supported and evolves into entrepreneurial practices through socially constructed communities. A close look at the practices of entrepreneurship educators in a Danish Higher Education institute stimulated an analysis of what these teachers do and say they are doing in the entrepreneurship classroom."

This is because self-efficacy influences the motivation and ability to engage in specific activities (Bandura, 1977) and is a strong, necessary condition of creative productivity, and in discovering new knowledge (Bandura, 1997). Although the concept of self-efficacy can be used as a promising tool to understand creativity and has been practically tested by Tierney and Farmer (2002), entrepreneurial self-efficacy (ESE) as a multi-dimensional construct remains under theorized. The aim of this paper is to provide details of a study and methodology in order to offer an example of a usable survey tool plus preliminary results from the data collected through a specific project called CAL4INO.Creative Activities in Learning for Innovation (CAL4INO) is a European Union funded project that focuses primarily on identifying the impact of different types of learning activities on the innovation potential of participants.

To address this area of neglect we conducted a two-phase research project. The first phase was guided by the question: What teaching and learning (T&amp;L) strategies should be employed in SHRM? This question was investigated using data gathered in three focus groups involving T&amp;L specialists, strategic management and HRM academics, and HRM practitioners. Through a process of successive focussing, potential T&amp;L strategies were initially identified and then tested and refined in the focus groups. Drawing on input from the participants and the literature, we make the case that SHRM can be effectively taught through a combination of primarily case-based and problem-based approaches. We also illustrate how process worksheets can be employed to provide problem solving support to students when they carry out complex learning tasks based on authentic SHRM problems. The second phase focussed on the question: How effective are the T&amp;L strategies? To address this question we analysed data collected from students about the effectiveness of the T&amp;L strategies. We also report our critical reflections on the experience of applying the T&amp;L strategies in practice."

Moreover, very little research has been conducted regarding the question whether socio-economic background has an impact on effectiveness of entrepreneurship programs in general and in schools in particular. In this paper we focused not only on the general efficacy of teaching entrepreneurship to adolescents, but we also examined if socio-economic status has a moderating effect on this process. Longitudinal data were gathered from 19 schools located in different socio-economic environments in the center of Israel, sampling 630 matched pairs of students half of which participated in the “Doing Business” program operated by Junior Achievement Israel, and the other half that functioned as a control group. Findings showed that when controlling for socio-economic school environments, the program was very effective for pupils in schools located in middle and high socio-economic environments. For pupils from low socio-economic environments, on the other hand, the program seemed to change their entrepreneurial attitudes in the wrong direction. In terms of self-efficacy, perceived feasibility and perceived desirability, participating pupils actually ranked lower after having taken part in the program. Thus, the data show that while the program is very effective for middle and upper class adolescents, encouraging them to become more entrepreneurial, it is detrimental to pupils from lower socio-economic environments, which value themselves with less self-efficacy and see entrepreneurship as less feasible and desirable when they finish the program. Moreover, even their business knowledge does not seem to have improved significantly. We recommend creating entrepreneurial education programs that are geared specifically to the needs of pupils from lower socio-economic environments."

They are organised typically into tutorials comprising creative learners who network in a simulated industry in the classroom to complete assessments. We see similarity between our simulations with computer generated micro-biological simulations of ‘autocatalysis’ that explain how cellular development in living organisms occurs at the edge of chaos. This paper uses autocatalysis to develop a theoretical explanation of why human networks ‘come alive’ even in classroom simulations, as networks of learners generate blue ocean futuristic ideas, bringing them into the realm of current technological and human capabilities. We explore this through a three year longitudinal study of 24 different industries simulated by creative learners. The contribution of this paper is in the explanation of networking as a part of learning in HE that goes beyond simple group work. In addition to the development of soft skills, HE learners are introduced to communication processes of coping with instability and complexity within industry networks."

Finally, the role of gender in moderating this relationship is tested. Data were collected at the beginning and the end of a semester-long, introductory entrepreneurship course. Findings show that while ESE increased for both groups, this increase was statistically significant only for the male students. In addition, while entrepreneurial intentions did not change in a statistically significant way for either gender subgroup, findings revealed a positive correlation between ESE and EI, showing this relationship to be moderated by gender. These findings suggest that gender must be integrated into any study of ESE and EI. Results also imply that current entrepreneurship education programs may not be effectively reaching females and may need to be redesigned."

Such companies need creative people to help solve their most pressing problems, and to help generate new sources of value creation for firms that have suffered years of stagnant growth. A quick glance at recent business books and magazines shows that the need for such individuals is strong and growing, as global competition becomes the new normal and economies around the world become increasingly connected. As business educators we need to reflect on how we should go about designing classes and curricular that develop creative capabilities in our students. This paper outlines an integrated approach to enhancing creativity at the individual, group, and organizational levels that is used in a Creativity Course taught at a large University in the United States. In doing so it is presented in two parts. Part I describes the conceptual underpinnings of the course and the three module framework that is used to structure content. Thus, Part I focuses on describing what is taught and explaining why. Part II illustrates how the course is implemented through a series of both individual and group projects. Additionally, it reflects on key learning outcomes that have occurred through the delivery of multiple iterations of the course. Together Part I and II combine to create a complete learning resource for anyone interested in developing and delivering a course on creativity."

Yet, only limited empirical work has been carried out to shed light on how these programs are developed and how and why they are designed and organized the way that they are. What we do know typically comes to us from single-case reports on isolated programs. This study aims to provide deeper insights through an innovative and comprehensive research design that provides a way to compare and contrast case studies of five programs, developed by different educators, in different Nordic nations, and at different HE STEM institutions. The study mainly aims to explore how these cross-case and cross-national studies can guide future entrepreneurship education program development. However, considering the deliberate selection of comparable cases, this study finds a striking diversity in effective and successful programs, and uncovers strong interdependencies between program design and inception and the program developers. As such, in addition to providing guidance for program developers, the study identifies implications for other stakeholders, including students, university management, and entrepreneurship education research."

Ecological approaches are used at the University of Tasmania to heighten the awareness of students to a raft of difficult to observe environmental factors associated with developing enterprising ideas. At Sheffield University, the discovery and exploitation of entrepreneurial opportunities is viewed as a co-evolving system of emerging business ideas, and routines/heuristics respectively. It is argued that using both approaches enables students to develop a greater awareness of their situated environment, and ultimately the degree of fit between their learning process and a changing external world. The authors argue that in order to improve the chances of longer-term survival what is needed is a new level of organisation where the individual is capable of developing a representation of the external world that he or she can use to sense the appropriateness of local decisions. This reinterpretation of events allows individuals to step back and examine the broader consequences of their actions through the interpretation and anticipation of feedback from the environment. These approaches thus seek to develop practice-based heuristics which individuals can use to make sense of their lived experiences, as they learn to evolve in an increasingly complex world."

Eight barriers to such inclusion were identified such as proselytizing and the misuse of power. The sampled instructors also made some suggestions for how to include spirituality topics, such as using respected resources and linking classroom discussions to practice. Overall, instructors' preference for including spiritual topics also varied in terms of explicit versus implicit and organic-emergent versus preplanned-structured approaches."

The influence of education for entrepreneurship and education through entrepreneurship on pupils' level of school engagement and entrepreneurial intentions is analysed and assessed. The paper builds on and extends research about entrepreneurship education for pupils at the lower secondary and upper secondary levels of education (Johannisson, 2010; Pepin, 2012; Peterman &amp; Kennedy, 2003; Surlemont, 2007) by including theories about cognitive and non-cognitive skill formation (Bowles &amp; Gintis, 1976, 2002; Cunha &amp; Heckman, 2007, 2008, 2010), school engagement (Fredricks, Blumenfeld, &amp; Paris, 2004; Libbey, 2004), and purposeful learning (Illeris, 2009; Newmann, 1991; Wentzel &amp; Brophy, 2013) in the theoretical framework. It is found that education for entrepreneurship, which focuses on content and cognitive entrepreneurial skills, has a positive influence on pupils' entrepreneurial intentions but a negative influence on their level of school engagement. The opposite is true for education through entrepreneurship, which has a more pedagogical orientation and focuses on fostering non-cognitive entrepreneurial skills. Furthermore, the role of supportive teaching styles and action-based teaching methods in entrepreneurship education at this level of education is investigated. The analysis is based on data from two surveys including 801 randomly selected Danish ninth-graders (aged 14–15) and 576 randomly selected Danish tenth-graders (aged 15–16). The findings have implications for policy makers and curriculum designers, inasmuch as the influence of two educational approaches is assessed and analysed, but also for the academic community since it presents an alternative way to assess educational dimensions (content and teaching methods) separately."

How organizational learning contracts can refocus B-schools on the business of learning","Gerard Beenen Paul S Goodman",2014,"The International Journal of Management Education","d4eb8bf5-50e8-3347-858c-28f69b89a540","Learning outcomes Organizational learning contract Self-regulated learning","The distractions of higher rankings and better facilities are diluting business schools from their intended focus on facilitating student learning. We propose organizational learning contracts (OLCs) can help B-schools regain their focus by creating shared expectations about the roles and responsibilities of relevant parties in regards to learning. We show students at an institution with a stronger OLC displayed more effective, self-regulated conceptions of the learning process (e.g., being self-motivated, seeking feedback), and less conventional beliefs regarding how to learn (e.g., attending class, doing homework). Given these benefits, we discuss how to implement an OLC, and its implications for management education."

From literature about assessment and impact of entrepreneurship education and social entrepreneurship education, a number of interrelated factors are identified that are important to address in assessment and measurement of impact. In addition to these factors, a supplementary dimension is suggested – the holistic person perspective – in order to offer a measurement approach beyond the borders of a single course or program. From a case study of social entrepreneurship at the Humanities in Denmark, it is described how students develop entrepreneurial experiences both in courses, between courses and in their daily life. The argument of the article is that it can be fruitful to understand entrepreneurial activities in a dynamic and holistic manner with attention to extended time and space dimensions in order to fully capture assessment and impact of entrepreneurship education."

It represents a novel approach to assessing entrepreneurial education. A longitudinal design was applied following three engineering students during nine intensive months. Students were equipped with a mobile smartphone app used to report emotional events and critical learning events. Reports were followed up quarterly with semi-structured interviews. Links were identified through data analysis software NVIVO. Findings indicate a large number of links between emotional events and developed entrepreneurial competencies. Three kinds of emotional events strongly linked to developed entrepreneurial competencies were interaction with outside world, uncertainty and ambiguity and team-work experience. These emotional events were linked to formation of entrepreneurial identity, increased self-efficacy, increased uncertainty and ambiguity tolerance and increased self-insight. These links represent early empirical evidence for three effective design principles of entrepreneurial education, and can also be used as indirect measures in assessment. This study also confirms venture creation programs as a suitable environment for studying entrepreneurship as experience. Limitations of this study include a small number of interviewees, unknown transferability of results to other contexts, and risk for individual bias in data coding."

It was found that team dynamics emerged as the most important dimension followed by instructor's role and learning process. The activities in simulation exercises which enhance team cohesiveness and effective role playing are detrimental for the perception of positive effective learning."

The findings do not indicate that graduates of AACSB accredited schools experience greater career success than graduates from non-accredited schools or that the learning outcomes of students enrolled at AACSB accredited schools exceed those of non-accredited schools. Because of the lack of generally accepted metrics for evaluating quality improvement for institutions whose missions are primarily teaching, there is no empirical evidence to determine whether AACSB accreditation enhances or retards quality improvement for institutions whose missions are primarily teaching. The implications of the findings for the subject institutions and for AACSB are discussed."

In addition, the current findings are compared to those of a twin survey conducted in 2006to test MBA ‘value’ under contrasting labor market conditions. The findings indicate that an MBA contributes considerably to most of the managerial skills, although relevant criticisms regarding a gap between MBA programs and business needs are not groundless. The MBA also helps graduates to find enriched jobs with increasing compensation over time. On the other hand, it exerts moderate to negligible influence on the selection/hiring process, job hopping and promotions. Contrasting the 2006 survey with the current one, it is found that an MBA degree tends to enhance graduates' careers in both economic boom and decline periods."

There is a widely held belief that the number of students starting a business immediately after graduation is minimal. Thus, questions are being raised about the ‘value’ an entrepreneurial education provides. Though the extant literature abounds with studies of the mechanics of entrepreneurial education, few query students about the perceived value they received from it. Our study addresses this gap by assessing the value of a Master of Entrepreneurship programme via the use of student reflections. The main benefits that graduates gained are increased confidence, insights into the feasibility of their new venture idea, entrepreneurship knowledge and skills, an appreciation of what it is like to be an entrepreneur, and solutions to practical problems. However, few students appear to appreciate the long-term benefits of networking with visiting entrepreneurs, guest speakers, lecturers, and fellow students. Implications for entrepreneurship education research and practice are discussed."

This paper argues that an alternative approach, based upon embedding transferable skills into the curriculum, produces more consistent and sustainable results than policy led enterprise programme initiatives, especially when informed by a systematic and integrated transferable skills framework. This paper analyses the provision and nature of the transferable skills associated with four, highly successful, enterprise programmes. Using content analysis and a thematic coding system, existing programme documents are analysed to generate a service based framework of transferable skills that can be embedded across institutions. The findings suggest that resource sensitive initiatives are problematic with regard to maintaining sustainable learning programmes and that an embedded transferable skills approach offers greater consistency. We conclude with a framework of transferable skills informed by empirical research, designed to embed such skills across the curriculum, thus shaping the 21st century graduate. The service based framework is an institutional tool for programmes and curriculum design beyond the business school and offers an alternative approach to embedding enterprise education."

Targeted at teachers from multiple disciplines within three universities in Denmark, the program's main objective is to influence the teachers' perception about entrepreneurship education and provide them with skills and tools to embed entrepreneurial skills and thinking in their courses in order to expose a wider cross-section of university students to entrepreneurship. The qualitative analysis based on semi-structured interviews focuses on the experience of the teachers of one participant university. It focuses on the role of teachers and emphasizes their perceptions and intention formation through the framework of the Theory of Planned Behavior. The results suggest that the program can positively impact the teacher's perception although the link to intentions is less easily established."

This is due to a gap in our theoretical understanding of what it takes to become entrepreneurial. Research suggests that beyond acquiring knowledge and skill to act entrepreneurially, entrepreneurial learning also involves the development of an entrepreneurial identity. Yet most accounts of entrepreneurship education do not include this concept. We explore entrepreneurial identity and how it is constructed within an entrepreneurship education. Connecting entrepreneurial learning theory with literature on identity, we developed a set of categories addressing the construction of an entrepreneurial identity. In a case study at a European technical university, we used these categories to sample and analyze narrative data developed as students created new ventures. The results support our supposition that, in the context of a new venture creation program, students experience challenges that lead to the development of entrepreneurial identity. Based on these findings, we argue that, if the educational objective is learning for the practice of entrepreneurship, then identity construction needs to be seen as important a goal as the development of knowledge and skill."

It surveys the contemporary theories of adult learning applied to entrepreneurship education, and then presents the theory of expansive learning within a Cultural Historical Activity Theory framework. The Change Laboratory, a kind of formative intervention developed within this framework and aiming to trigger expansive learning, seeks to redefine work practises through participation and dialectics among the stakeholders within the organization or at the boundaries of intersecting organizations. This model is applied to entrepreneurship education. In Italy and Australia small groups of vocational students undertaking long periods of work experience took part in Change Laboratory workshops. During the workshops the students, together with the researcher, their work tutors and teachers discussed the problems students were having at the boundary between school and work. They found shared solutions and put them into practice. In this process the students displayed entrepreneurial behaviour. The article analyzes the triggering events and the banners made during the workshops by the students in Italy and Australia as proof of expansive learning, as well reflective and transformative learning processes at the boundary."

One response has been a shift to constructionist perspectives where learning is seen as an active process of constructing rather than merely acquiring knowledge. We wonder how is it possible for students, lacking much professional experience, to ‘construct’ useful entrepreneurial knowledge? We address this question by analysing the learning experiences of 54 students and 19 lecturers in different European Entrepreneurship education programs. The study explores the nature and processes of entrepreneurial learning in the university context. It provides understanding of how learners – across cultures and educational backgrounds – engage in the learning process. We identify three personal qualities, which constitute this process: a multi-dimensional sense of responsibility, independent ways of thinking, and the ability to connect to ones own and other peoples' needs. We identified the particular dynamics in which these qualities interact and develop and conclude with suggestions on how education may stimulate this process."

We suggest that existing literature on PLG's and SDL does not, so far, explore in detail messy contexts where organisational pressures on teaching teams lead to multiple, conflicting objectives that do not allow for a rational delivery of the anticipated pedagogic strategy. Recognising further the relatively limited amount of studies within a HRM teaching context, we seek to contribute to the SDL literature by outlining the problems that can occur when there are hidden objectives behind the use of SDL. We further suggest that the full-time MBA context may be particularly opposed to the use of SDL due to specific student expectations of ‘appropriate’ modes of delivery."

The study focuses on the effectiveness of George Kelly's repertory grids, the methodological tool of Personal Construct Theory (PCT), as an innovative pedagogical tool in entrepreneurship education. The student experience and the perceived advantages and disadvantages and relevance of the tool were systematically explored in a post-course survey conducted among a similar number of postgraduate students in both countries, 60 in Poland and 55 in France. A theoretical model that connects social learning theory to Gestalt perception underpins content analysis of the qualitative data. Repertory grids are shown to have value as both a network analysis tool and for encouraging reflection. Repertory grids empower the student to be proactive in thinking about their network and as encouraging collaboration among learners. Hitherto repertory grids have been deployed as a research tool, but little is known of their value in teaching situations. This paper begins the process of establishing repertory grids as of educational as well as research value."

As well as integrating professional ethics into their curriculum, Business Schools are also developing standalone ethics courses, showing that they take seriously their responsibility to help prepare the next generation of managers to improve business' track record of transparency, accountability and sustainable development. However what are the learning approaches that will help to bring about real improvements in business ethics learning at university? This paper argues that a holistic approach to ethics teaching is needed, in which students are encouraged to develop ethical knowledge and skills within their personal value systems. In this way ethics does not become something apart but integrated into one's terms of reference. The paper discusses a particular pedagogic approach designed to develop a student's ‘critical consciousness’ using a student-led learning method in which students actively engage with important concepts and discuss the issues amongst themselves within an environment where they can speak freely. Qualitative interviews with a selection of undergraduates on the compulsory first year professional ethics module provide insight into the impact of the method on attitudes and behaviours."

Management educators and other stakeholders need to respond. To this end, we argue that a shared understanding amongst stakeholders concerning complexity and risk is both urgent and mutually beneficial. Ideally it would lead to collaborative design of curriculum and pedagogy and avoid overly narrow specialisation. We use the notion of ‘holism’ to explore the difficulties in comprehending the span of change in contemporary business, presenting ‘holistic risk’ as a vital but aspirational construct transcending boundaries, functions and disciplines. Specifically we address implications for teaching and learning holistic risk, for related program goals and curriculum design, and for embedding critical analytical skills into curriculum, arguing that students engage with holistic risk throughout the entire spectrum of problem-solving. Thus, educators must grapple with helping students in this effort. In support, we offer examples of our own practice in curriculum design and pedagogy. We conclude that the concept of holism might provoke a better understanding between educators and industry stakeholders concerning knowledge and skills to deal with risks associated with dynamic shifts in business environments. Such collaboration could help students operate more confidently in fluid, unpredictable business settings."

The researchers followed a naturalist-paradigm as a research design to investigate the feedback on assessment phenomenon in a moderately collectivist and high risk avoiding society. Qualitative data is collected through conducting four focus groups with 18 higher degree students, enrolled in the last years of their degree programs. The sample of students has been selected using purposive sampling technique from a private sector university located in the province of Punjab, Pakistan. Thematic analysis revealed eight themes: satisfaction with feedback, scope of the feedback, demand for feedback, continuity of feedback, mode of feedback communication, timing of the feedback, competence of instructors, and student–instructor relationships &amp; feedback. It has also been notable that role of instructors is considered imperative in enhancing the impact of feedback provided on assessment. This research is a pioneer study in the Asian context of Pakistan and contributes significantly to raise the standards of teaching and assessment in the country. The insights are useful for faculty members, teaching to higher degree students, and striving hard to achieve the desired outcomes of feedback on assessment."

Elements of Hofstede's cultural dimensions were used to develop a theoretical framework for this study. An abductive approach was taken using systematic combining where interviews with UK and Chinese students were integrated with academic literature to ascertain general perceptions towards peer feedback and assessment. From these interviews four attitudinal issues were extracted – how comfortable students are with an assessment mode, how important they find the mode, fairness of the assessment mode, and how useful they find the mode. A survey was then distributed to final year marketing students and their perceptions of these issues were assessed. These results were subsequently presented to separate focus groups for their insights into the survey outcomes. The principal findings of the study are that there are cultural barriers to fair and consistent formal peer assessment of group work involving heterogeneous populations, particularly pertaining to collectivist/individualist backgrounds as exemplified in this study."

This paper also aims to challenge the current approach of assessing educational performance by cross-sectional analysis, a widespread short-term instrument for assessing multi-variable behavior among different entities at a same moment. In contrast with a cross-sectional approach, our research has adopted the time-series analysis, a long-term methodology that can generate econometric coefficients and parameters from a cause-effect investigation, which is more appropriate for the purpose of drawing up projections and forecasts. Because our analysis extends over time, we develop, by the end of the study, an Abacus for Education based on cause-effect relationships derived from time series, the use of which will assist in understanding the future impact of educational policies, and therefore lead to the development of better policies. This paper makes two important contributions: it provides empirical evidence on the effects of public expenditure on educational effectiveness and it also sheds light on methodological issues by indicating that endogenous and exogenous variables can help in predicting values for public education outcomes."

Using four case studies of United Kingdom (UK) universities, the research identifies the differences between organisations that are making good progress toward implementing their internationalisation strategy and those that are finding it more difficult. The literature review combines three sets of literature on: the internationalisation of HE, management of HE institutions and strategic management. Based on the literature three main challenges to UK universities implementing organisation wide internationalisation are identified and a set of organisational pre-requisite qualities are suggested, which if put in place will provide should produce sound basis on which to implement an internationalisation strategy. The literature suggests that contemporary universities are international businesses and as such should give more serious consideration to how their internationalisation strategy is managed. The research indicates that some UK universities are struggling to come to terms with their new operating environment and whilst they nearly all have international strategies, they need to pay more attention to the implementation of those strategies."

The main aim of this study is to measure students' sense of belonging in the context of the university environment across three London universities. Goodenow's (1993) Psychological Sense of School Membership instrument was utilised to collect quantitative data. Analysis of the data suggests that most students do seem to develop a sense of belonging by week 7 of semester one, but a significant minority (10–15%) of students in each institution do not. This report concludes that these students are more likely to have some issues settling in and feeling that they are accepted in the university environment. Unfortunately, experiencing a lack of social integration is a factor that encourages students to leave education. These students may require support if they are to gain a strong sense of belonging to their institution. It is also apparent that active participation in curricular activity is strongly correlated with a higher sense of belonging."

The study indicates that the variables that have traditionally explained the existence of training processes within a company, such as larger company size, a better-educated workforce, or an employment relationship of indefinite duration, are not useful when explaining why a company is more likely to train its workers using e-learning. Instead, intensive use of digital technology (ICT), the capability to innovate with such technologies or a greater adaptability in work processes explains, to a large extent, the probability of e-learning in the organisations. This fact produces a virtuous circle between ICT learning and practice at the “digitised” workplace. This research is based upon data obtained from a survey made with a sample of 2,038 executives representing the Catalan business sector."

Semi-structured interviews are used to obtain data from a sample of 30 business degree students at a UK university. The findings confirm previous studies, that financial necessity is a primary driver of part-time work, but also reveal a complex set of supplementary reasons, that either satisfies a long-term vision, or a more immediate need for development or self-gratification. Furthermore, most students compromise the longer-term benefit of study against the more immediate financial gains offered by work, resulting in an accepted lowering of academic performance as a consequence. The majority of the students did not see a connecting opportunity between their part-time work and future career, and were uncertain regarding future career direction. This study extends the use of qualitative methods in this area, which is dominated by survey research, while also extending extant findings to the career aspirations of students, which is hitherto largely unexplored."

This study investigates how 674 recent business graduates perceived their own capabilities in oral communication skills, noting variations by background/demographic characteristics. Overall, business graduates rated their capabilities in oral communication highly although mean ratings for the 14 sub-behaviours varied. Certain sub-behaviours varied with graduate age and time spent working since graduation. Findings suggest a disparity between graduate and employer perceptions on the standard of oral communication skills upon graduation. Participants also considered the effectiveness of different learning activities for developing oral communication skills during their undergraduate studies. Popular learning activities were individual/group presentations and small group projects. The number of activity types engaged in during degree studies did not significantly impact perceived capabilities and only peer feedback, individual and group presentations caused significant variations in certain sub-behaviours. Despite graduates reporting opportunities for a wide range of learning activities, these are not always effective. Strategies for education and professional practitioners for enhancing graduate oral communication skill outcomes are discussed."

The purpose of this paper is threefold: (1) demonstrate various sequential processes in using films to explain theories (deduction) and draw generalizations based on single-case scenarios (induction), (2) illustrate varying learning sequences proposed by Whetten and Clark's (1996) integrated learning model and our deductive and inductive approaches to teaching management theories, and (3) share additional examples for using films to teach management using both approaches. Survey questionnaires were used for comparison of inductive and deductive processes. Results support Lott's (1983) assertion that both deductive and inductive processes are effective means for teaching. Qualitative feedback shows slightly better concept retention using an inductive process to teach management theories using films."

Mind maps were used in this study to explore these concerns. Specifically, undergraduate and MBA students, and business school faculty performed a mind mapping exercise for a complex, multifaceted problem. Results supported concerns about students' intellectual development. Mind maps indicated that advanced undergraduate and advanced MBA students partitioned knowledge into distinct silos and that their knowledge bases were thin. In contrast, business school faculty developed rich mind maps characterized by dense connections among concepts. Implications of these findings for business school pedagogy were discussed."

Through focus groups with 32 undergraduate and postgraduate students, we found: i) participants had limited experience of sharing skills; ii) they were more frequently engaged in sharing their beliefs, values and ideas; iii) while interpersonal relationships impacted upon the degree to which knowledge sharing took place, the major contributing factor was participants' desired outcomes. Participants identified different advantages and disadvantages for the same allocation methods depending on their motivations for attending their courses. We conclude that the most equitable approach to group work is to allow students to choose the allocation method most appropriate to their needs. Findings can assist educators in making informed decisions about group work to increase student engagement, and support cognition-based trust to enhance knowledge sharing."

All three employer groups, and accounting faculty, found personal integrity to be an exceedingly important characteristic for potential hires. Accounting students indicated personal integrity to be significantly less important than did their real-world counterparts. This and similarly unexpected findings suggest that many accounting students and accounting educators do not know which attributes are most important to potential employers."

One way to attract students to accounting is to place more emphasis on recruitment. Because all business majors take accounting principles, this would seem to be the appropriate place to focus recruitment efforts. This assumes, however, that the instructor has significant influence on students' decisions to major in accounting. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the influence of the accounting principles instructor on students' decisions to major in accounting. The study also provides insight into the timing of discipline-choice decisions by accounting majors and other factors relevant to the recruitment process for accounting majors."

Undergraduate business students (n = 347) were videotaped during an AC session consisting of an in-basket, two leaderless group discussions, and a speech. Trained raters used behavioral checklists to evaluate performance. AC scores correlated moderately with traditional evaluation techniques, suggesting that ACs measure knowledge acquisition in addition to skills acquired but not captured by traditional techniques. Their use is thus consistent with the emphasis on skill-based learning."

Rather, the number of newly accredited schools has remained constant over time, and the change in character has been a gradual one that began well before the standards revision. Nevertheless, the AACSB has become a more inclusive institution, extending accreditation to more schools that are teaching rather than research oriented, namely, those without doctoral programs, with lower enrollments, and with more part-time faculty. The trend has also been to accredit schools with more women and minority students and lower GMAT scores."

It is considerably more difficult to assess teaching effectiveness than it is to assess research productivity, and the fundamental indicator of teaching effectiveness, career success of graduates, is virtually impossible to measure accurately. Business school faculties preparing for accreditation or re-accreditation thus are forced to emphasize superficial and unreliable indicators such as the number of course changes approved by curriculum committees. The AACSB should devise a set of reasonable accreditation standards, with numerical guidelines established for measurable variables, and issue Certificates of Distinction to a minority of business schools that maintain very high levels of faculty research productivity."

To test if Hong Kong constitutes a sound proxy for understanding Chinese business students, this study compared the rationales of students in the Mainland (n = 71) and Hong Kong (n = 68) for undertaking an MBA. Significant differences were found overall and by sex, age, and educational background."

To determine whether various grade-influencing activities in accounting courses favor certain personality types, the personality preferences and temperaments of 82 intermediate accounting students were determined. Relationships were then found between personality variables and the number of class absences, class participation, and the performance on homework and problems on the final examination."

Women are now on the verge of dominating the accounting workplace. Litigation has become ever present, and the 150-hour requirement has been adopted in most states. A call has been issued for a better educated accounting graduate, and information in accounting areas such as history, ethics, international applications, and computers is exploding. Meanwhile, classroom hours in the first accounting courses have shrunk by 40% at most universities. This article offers suggestions for more effective teaching of the ?first course in accounting? through visual aids and use of the concepts approach."

Adjunct instructors, hired on a term-by-term basis, are easily replaced; thus, most face serious pressure to earn good evaluations from students. Keeping students happy may mean giving higher, potentially inflated, grades. This study explicitly compared the average class grade given by adjunct instructors and full-time faculty over a 2-year period at a small public university. The results suggest that adjunct instructors do give higher grades than do full-time faculty."

In this study, 447 individuals (working and retired) aged 50 and over completed the California Work and Health survey. Most of the working respondents (n = 150) were employed full-time and worked in education, health care, government, and retail trade. Those working reported being in greater health, being less depressed, and having more energy and activities than those retired. There was no difference between those working and retired in social and psychological characteristics such as number of friendships and ability to control important things in life and overcome difficulties. Educating managers and business professionals about these characteristics is essential given anticipated social security system changes in the future."

The AECC issued the statements to provide a framework for the reform of accounting classrooms. A 35-item concerns questionnaire was mailed to all 2-year and 4-year accounting educators in 1 state. Results indicate that these professors are inexperienced users of the AECC's position and issues statements, although some exceptions were noted. The results indicate that accounting educators need further exposure to the AECC statements, including the details of how to teach in a reform-consistent manner."

Although content and presentation-related decisions are paramount to the success of the programs, other, more subtle issues are of equal importance, including the attitudes, infrastructure, and resources to successfully implement such an extensive and potentially disruptive curricular change. These issues represent the foundation on which the programs will be established. This artcle presents these foundational issues and the influence they have on the success or failure of integration efforts. A short ?Readiness Test? is included to facilitate future integration efforts."

Instructional Issues","Ronald O Reed John Elsea Martha S Lilly",2000,"Journal of Education for Business","25ebc78d-7a22-35f6-86b7-851f6c2ac0e2",NA,"Abstract The current trend of accounting for excess purchase price that relates to intangible items not identified as separate assets, in a business acquisition, is to account for it either by expensing or capitalizing it. Even though current standards suggest that companies capitalize the excess as goodwill, in many instances, the current practice is to expense it. In this article, we discuss the issue as an example of how accounting is being challenged constantly by unique and sometimes very aggressive accounting policies for managing net income by management. The example also gives instructors an opportunity to incorporate several issues related to accounting policy, accounting alternatives, and subjective judgment into their financial accounting courses."

Simultaneously, the supply of graduate accounting programs in the United States has increased dramatically. This article (a) describes that recent increase in graduate programs, (b) provides evidence of an association between the proportion of universities offering graduate accounting degrees and implementation of the 150-hour requirement, and (c) projects the expected growth in graduate accounting programs over the next 10 years. Our results suggest that higher education is responding to state-mandated 150-hour requirements by increasing the supply of graduate accounting programs. Moreover, there is likely to be a growth of approximately 17% in graduate accounting programs over the next 10 years."

Evidence From Beijing MBA Students","Edmund R Thompson",2000,"Journal of Education for Business","93faf912-ec61-37ae-9651-4e5cbc0f4e7d",NA,"Abstract Business programs in Mainland China have witnessed an increased interest in the use of China- and Asia-related cases. This increased interest is predicated on two assumptions: (a) Chinese students are as receptive to case-method teaching as Western students, and (b) locally oriented cases are more effective than material developed outside Asia. Using data gathered directly from over 76 MBA students at a top Beijing university, this study offers strong empirical support for the use of cases, particularly those concerning Chinese firms. These results also support decisional over illustrative cases, and cases on service as opposed to manufacturing firms, and highlight some significant gender-related differences."

Many negative experiences can be attributed to lack of development in team processes. Business organizations train teams extensively for successful functioning.

Companies, and by extension countries, that succeed will be those who can evolve as quickly as the economic landscape. American colleges and universities have traditionally been the training ground for businesses seeking global managers. Their ability to produce graduates for this new marketplace may depend on structural realignment among themselves, accrediting agencies, business, and government. In this article, I explore how academic preparation efforts during the past 2 decades have not effectively addressed the challenge of preparing students to manage on a global level. I present a review of the current situation and suggestions for structural change."

In this study, I surveyed a sample of students and faculty on their perceptions of the readability of, and emotion imparted by, 10 typefaces. I found that the majority of subjects agreed on the readability factor of 10 typefaces. My expectation that the majority of subjects would agree on the best-fit mood or emotion created by each of the typefaces was confirmed for four of the typefaces and refuted for six. Finally, I found a lack of consensus regarding the (a) overall easiest-to-read, (b) most-difficult-to-read, and (c) favorite typeface."

As a result, integration between IT and business-strategic functions is increasing. This new cross-functional economy requires Renaissance managers and employees who understand this convergence. In this article, the authors examine barriers that business schools must overcome to produce the needed cross-pollinated employees. Suggestions for business schools attempting to create timely and cross-functional business programs are also provided. Business schools should focus on knowledge development and cross-functional integration and largely cede skill-based training to alternative or ancillary venues. As well, they should integrate e-commerce and technology issues throughout the curriculum."

In light of the limited success of several e-commerce initiatives to guard privacy, the Federal Trade Commission has recommended that Congress consider legislation similar to that existing in the European Union to guarantee customers' privacy online. The authors discuss the conflict between the e-commerce community's need to collect data and customers' desire to protect their privacy, the privacy tools available to deal with these issues, the possible impact of privacy laws on the future profitability of e-commerce firms, and privacy as a component of any course involving e-commerce."

Moreover, the subtopic of strategy formulation is both the most pivotal and the most difficult to teach. As many theorists argue, strategy formulation is the ?black box? of strategic planning. One approach for both clarifying and teaching strategy formulation uses the thinking process tools of the theory of constraints. In this article, we briefly describe these thinking process tools and apply them to a popular introductory strategy case to illustrate how they can be used to teach strategy formulation. Implications of the thinking process for other strategic management issues are also discussed."

Significant differences in ethical orientation were found between newly arrived foreign students and foreign students who had spent considerable time studying in the United States (older foreign students). The authors compared the ethical orientations of older foreign students with those of American students to examine the degree of convergence in their approach to ethical issues. Results suggest that, after spending considerable time studying in U.S. business schools, foreign students modified their ethical orientations to include the values and beliefs of the new social environment."

The authors explored the effect of these three factors on students' perceptions of how much they learned in particular classes. They found that female instructors rated better than male ones and that ratings differed significantly by course type and by students' perceived amount of learning. Graduate students tended to give higher scores than undergraduates. These findings could indicate that comparing evaluation data across different courses might not produce valid overall effectiveness rankings."

The course described enabled students to learn the theory and pricing of derivative securities. Students received instruction entirely through a home-based Web-enhanced system involving homepages, chat rooms, e-mail, and a Web container (Blackboard). The authors conclude that the necessary components for a successful distance learning course include comfort with this form of instruction by both faculty and students, availability of technical support, frequent communication for monitoring learning, detailed presentation of the topics, and new means for assessing learning."

The authors found that most students were comfortable with the computer and the Internet and that those in the computer-mediated instructional setting reported fairly positive attitudes. Survey results revealed no significant differences between the two groups in attitudes about the course. However, students who used the computer more frequently reported more positive attitudes about course delivery methods in general and specific course management software applications. These findings have important implications regarding technology's impact on accounting education."

The authors found that case studies were used frequently, which is consistent with high perceptions of their effectiveness. Their finding that group-process observation and item analysis were used infrequently is consistent with low perceptions of these methods' effectiveness. Five other methods were used fairly frequently. The findings show that, though faculty members use methods appropriate for assigning grades, they demonstrate infrequent use of methods that might be more effective for overall assessment of a program."

The academic program and development experience described occurred within the context of a graduate economics course that was developed in Japan and conducted on several occasions. The faculty who participated in this program assumed the role of student, not program leader, instructor, or coordinator. In this juxtapositional role, numerous experiential benefits, skills, and knowledge were acquired that otherwise would not have been possible. The intent of this article was to identify specific areas in which international professional development takes place and demonstrate how this international experience ultimately contributes to academic improvement."

Their results indicate that most accounting programs have responded to the 5-year requirement by simply encouraging CPA candidates to obtain a master's degree in accounting or a master's in business administration (MBA). The authors argue that this approach is inconsistent with the stated objectives of the 150-hour mandate. They suggest that the current implementation of the 5-year programs is not a viable long-term solution because its primary effect has been to increase the costs of accounting education, with questionable benefits."

The authors distributed an in-class questionnaire to a sample of business students from 6 different campuses (N = 1,051). The study was an attempt to bridge the gap between findings related to academic dishonesty and those regarding dishonesty in the workplace. The authors found that students who believed that cheating, or dishonest acts, are acceptable were more likely to engage in these dishonest behaviors. Additionally, students who engaged in dishonest acts in college classes were more likely to engage in dishonest acts in the workplace. The authors suggest some techniques to discourage dishonesty in the classroom."

Eighty-seven business majors (43 in accounting and 44 in marketing) returned responses to a questionnaire asking for their perceptions of the likelihood that they and others would engage in unethical behavior, given varying probabilities of their being caught and penalized. Respondents perceived themselves as less likely to engage in unethical behavior than the average person across all scenarios. Results indicated significantly higher levels of self-enhancement bias (SEB) for marketing majors; this difference was moderated by risk. As risk increased, group differences of SEB diminished. These results suggest that SEB may serve as an indicator of engagement in unethical behavior."

In this article, the authors raise the question of how far academics have come in applying the technology that they pioneered. To explore the use of Web-based teaching methods among U.S. business schools, the authors ask the following questions: How many (and what types of) course materials are available to students accessing information via the Internet? Have faculty discovered the on-ramp to the information superhighway or are they still parked in their own driveways?"

Though such a strategy may provide a higher short-run market valuation for the firm, it often has negative consequences in the longer term. MicroStrategy's regulatory problems stemmed from the new Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101 (SAB 101), issued in December 1999. The Bulletin was meant to provide guidance for accounting professionals to improve their financial reporting. Adherence to SAB 101 guidelines should result in more conservative revenue recognition practices and will provide investors with a more accurate picture of company performance."

In this article, the authors describe the use of case-based in-basket exercises (CIBEs) as a particularly effective way to elicit such writing. CIBEs require students not only to master course concepts but also to learn how to communicate what they know to a variety of professional audiences beyond the classroom. CIBEs require students to combine specialized functional area knowledge with analysis of communication contexts; thus they lead students to expertise, or the ability to adapt disciplinary content to varied audiences and purposes."

As a project moves through the selection, planning, execution, and termination phases, the project manager and team are faced with different, vying areas of concern?including the immediate task priorities, the probable sources of conflict, and the relevant critical factors for project success. Unfortunately, traditional representations of the project life cycle emphasize accounting-oriented aspects of the life cycle that are less interesting, such as percent complete and level of effort. In this article, the authors introduce a new framework, the eye diagram, that illustrates the more substantive aspects of the life cycle concept in an intuitive and accessible format."

In this article, the author describes how collaborative activities?ranging from exams to projects and role playing?enhance the understanding of operations management (OM). The author found that collaborative learning improved undergraduate business students' understanding of quantitative OM methods, developed their strategic-thinking skills, and enhanced their confidence in their critical-thinking and implementation skills. The exercises also increased students' comfort level in communicating and working with their peers and enhanced their independent learning skills."

Ninety-eight questionnaires (22%) were returned. Respondents identified five topics?equal employment opportunity/affirmative action (EEO/AA), employee rights and responsibilities, recruitment, selection, and compensation?as most important. They considered internship experience to be more valuable than professional human resource certification and indicated that HR curricula should reflect workplace and societal trends, general business understanding, and communication and teamwork skills. For HR curriculum development, the authors suggest a ""niche"" approach that provides in-depth training in some common HR functions, along with training in communication and teamwork skills."

These questionnaires require students to rate a wide range of items that may or may not be important to them. In this study, the authors supplemented these questionnaires by asking graduating business students to evaluate their university experiences by describing aspects that were especially successful and factors that needed improvement. This open-format, ""critical incidents"" approach to outcomes assessment readily generated recollections of incidents useful in guiding program change. The incidents provided additional perspective on data obtained from the College Student Experiences Questionnaire."

K. Curry's (1992) model of organizational institutionalization to a case study involving efforts to implement course and teaching portfolios in a small business school. This article is based on the personal observations of those involved and the published literature on the subject. Both teaching and course portfolios became part of the routinized behavior and culture of the school. The author argues that course portfolios, because of their focus on student learning, can greatly enhance the development of teachers, assist in creating a culture of evidence around learning outcomes, and foster the scholarship of teaching and learning."

The framework makes use of broad, economic contracting notions to supplement the traditional decision-usefulness approach to accounting. The contracting perspective more explicitly considers the incentives of all parties to the various contracts with the entity and the information environment in which decisions are made. The approach, which can be applied with any textbook in multiple settings, supports a ""discovery"" mode of learning focusing on the methods and skills of inquiry, analysis, judgment, and decision making."

The author analyzed graduate student papers for plagiarism over the course of 5 semesters. Students in the last 3 semesters plagiarized significantly less than did students in the 1st semester, suggesting that students' awareness of the system and its use by the instructor may have acted as a deterrent to plagiarism. Results showed that the system was a viable means to detect and discourage plagiarism in an academic environment. The author provides conclusions, limitations, and recommendations for faculty use of a plagiarism detection system."

In this study, the authors sought to determine whether students' and employees' perceptions of family issues differed in their responses to nine statements. Two-tailed t tests revealed significant differences between students and employees on the following issues: raising a family while having a career, staying home with children (with respect to women), special considerations, and additional leave. The authors' results suggest that organizations should implement practices in an equitable manner. Students, however, should be encouraged to research prospective employers to determine whether their family-issue needs will be met."

Two study approaches have been clearly identified: deep and surface. In this study, the author examined the way in which students approach studying introductory accounting courses. In general, he found that GPA and expected course grade were correlated positively with using the deep approach to studying. Compared with other business majors, accounting and nonbusiness majors used more deep and fewer surface approaches to studying. In addition, women and students who were more mature and senior employed the deep approach more often than did other students. The results have implications for the accounting instructor in these critical introductory courses."

The author's business school admitted students to three overseas MBA programs. The author then gathered academic performance data (MBA grades) and correlated the predictor (GMAT) with the criterion (MBA GPA). The findings showed that the correlation between the two was. 64 (p <.001), meaning that 41% of the variance in MBA academic performance was explained by the GMAT. This number is higher than the corresponding one for U.S. students. The findings indicate that the GMAT was a valid predictor of academic performance in an MBA program for these non-U.S. students."

The balance sheet is also used in the Uniform Commercial Code process, in which one must classify the collateral to know the procedural steps to follow to become a secured creditor. The balance-sheet approach helps students identify inventories, real property (land), intangible assets, accounts receivable, and so forth. The students use acronyms to organize the steps necessary for becoming a secured creditor. The acronym CAPP helps students understand that one must classify the collateral, attach the security interest, perfect it, and obtain priority."

Because salaries of current faculty members normally fail to keep up with market salaries, when a faculty line is vacated the college must pay a premium by offering a higher, competitive salary. In this study, the authors estimated the salary premium associated with filling a vacated finance faculty line. Results from a national survey show that the premiums required for replacing finance faculty members at all ranks are substantial."

Results show that interest in the subject was the most important factor for incoming freshmen, regardless of gender. For women, the next most influential factor was aptitude in the subject. However, men were significantly more influenced by the major's potential for career advancement and job opportunities and the level of compensation in the field. Students appeared to be driven to change their major because of positive factors about the new major, rather than negative factors related to the old major."

Anticipating that these changes could impair subsequent performance, the Department of Accounting instituted a new prerequisite for intermediate accounting: Students would have to pass either a pretest or a 1-unit course focusing on the accounting cycle. In this study, the authors analyzed the effectiveness of the screening/remedial system and concurrent effects on performance. They found that students who passed the pretest or accounting cycle class received significantly better grades in intermediate accounting than did students who failed either the pretest or the 1-unit course and than students who did not take either the pretest or the 1-unit class. This finding implies that this form of pretest/remedial course screen would be effective in similar universities in which a large percentage of accounting majors have taken introductory financial accounting at a community college."

The results showed that grade inflation existed and exhibited a linear trend over a 20-year period. The authors found that grade inflation was related to faculty status with significant differences seen between mean grade point averages of students being taught by tenured and adjunct faculty and between those students taught by nontenured and adjunct faculty. They also found that average grades given by adjunct faculty were higher than those of either tenured or nontenured faculty. Thus, the results indicate the increased use of adjunct faculty exacerbates grade inflation in higher education."

We content-analyzed the 21 current introductory marketing textbooks for coverage of these practices. The results showed limited, sporadic coverage of specific issues, with modest exposure to general environmental awareness. The audit indicated that exposure in pricing issues is more deficient than in other elements of the marketing mix. The 6 market leader texts were only marginally better at coverage than were the others. We concluded that, in the case of the environmentally sustainable practices, business schools have yet to incorporate this vitally important area into their curricula, in part because available textbooks lack sufficient coverage."

Five project management teams were formed in a graduate-level business course. At the conclusion of the projects, individuals were asked to assess both themselves and group peers by using a variety of evaluation methods. It is interesting to note that these data seemed to show a paradoxical relationship between ipsitive instrument accuracy and perceived importance. The author discusses other important ramifications for both the academic community and project management in general. He concludes with lessons learned from the study and posits avenues for future research."

The researchers discovered that games motivate students to actively participate in the learning process, encourage teamwork, and are as good as traditional means for reviewing management theories and vocabulary. Students reported that the use of games was an appropriate method of instruction that facilitated their learning. Students also indicated an overall preference for a participatory course and viewed other students as actively participating when games were used in courses."

However, after nearly 70 years of study, the results are inconclusive. Given the developments in computerized testing over the last decade, professors now have the ability to create and conduct frequent tests without severely impinging on other duties. In this article, the authors reexamine the issue in a marketing context, and the findings suggest that, under certain conditions, students tend to perform better with more frequent testing. In addition, more frequent testing tends to increase student evaluations of faculty. The authors also discuss reasons for and limitations of these findings."

In this study, the author investigated individual perceptions of simulation team dynamics and their relationship to student affect regarding the simulation as well as simulation performance in a sample of 172 responding students. The results showed that a student's affect regarding the simulation game was influenced by student team cohesion and student team independence. Alternatively, student simulation performance was influenced by team heterogeneity, opportunistic practices, and hypothesis-driven thinking. These findings encourage instructors to consider thoughtfully the outcomes they want students to experience when structuring student teams that will participate in simulation learning games."

To address this limitation, the goals of this study were (a) to identify marketing-related skills that students, alumni, and practitioners believe to be important; (b) to assess the importance that marketing faculty currently assign to these skills; and (c) to determine if faculty beliefs about these skills are longitudinally stable. The results of two original national surveys, fielded in 1995 and 2002, show that faculty view communication and cognitive skills as relatively more important than other skills and that faculty members' beliefs about the importance of different skills have not changed since 1995. Also, faculty beliefs fall into a stable structure of five basic skills groups?management, cognitive, communication, bridging, and interpersonal?which can be used as a framework to guide pedagogy and student assessment."

If it can be known and understood how professionals acquire expertise in evaluating the financial health of a firm, then it follows that structuring both the college classroom experience and the corporate training environment to enhance learning will be easier. In this article, the authors investigated the amount and types of information and tests requested by professionals concerning a firm in distress compared to those requested by intermediates and novices. The authors found that the amount and kinds of information and tests requested by novices differed significantly from that requested by experts in the field. Based on the results, the authors make recommendations to help business educators better prepare business students to recognize a firm in financial distress."

The authors examined data gathered from three courses, each with a different design, during one semester at a major university in the Southwest. One passive design was used and was patterned after the traditional method of lecture, notetaking, and multiple-choice exams. Two active designs were used. One active design was a participative course where students helped plan the course by developing the syllabus and deciding what criteria should be graded. The other active design was experiential in nature where students were exposed to assignments and activities designed to simulate real-world tasks and experiences. Results indicated that students perceived active course designs to be more useful to their future than passive designs. However, course design appeared to have no impact on student grades, satisfaction, or perceptions of how a course was conducted."

It also includes a comparison of participants' choice of style, as based on contextual factors, versus their expected choice of conflict handling approach, as based on their primary orientation, as given by a standardized self-report instrument. Under this format, participants were asked to analyze a set of five conflict episodes with differing situational contingencies and to choose action courses from among alternatives for handling the conflict. Group discussion then focused on a comparison of participants' choices of the situationally appropriate or optimal response and their personal conflict-handling orientations. The authors also discuss the conceptual framework guiding the development of the conflict scenarios."

Once they get to college, they tend to spend fewer hours studying while spending more hours working, some even full time (D. T. Smart, C. A. Kelley, & J. S. Conant, 1999). In this study, the authors examined the effect of both time spent studying and time spent working on academic performance. The authors further evaluated the interaction of motivation and ability with study time and its effect on academic performance. The results suggested that nonability variables like motivation and study time significantly interact with ability to influence academic performance. Contrary to popular belief, the amount of time spent studying or at work had no direct influence on academic performance. The authors also addressed implications and direction for future research."

Within academic and practitioners' communities, there have been constant discussions about the content of the IS core curriculum. In this article, the authors used a direct survey strategy to examine all undergraduate IS programs offered by business schools in the United States. The survey presents the core curricula of undergraduate IS programs based on accreditation criteria and the most recent IS curriculum model, IS 2002. The authors also compared the current results with those obtained 10 years ago in a separate study (J. L. Maier & S. Gambill, 1996). The research established the current baseline of undergraduate IS curricula and showed how the curricula have changed in the past decade. Information provided in this article should be valuable to IS educators and curriculum designers, as well as IS practitioners, to better understand the foundational knowledge transmitted to IS graduates."

The aim of the authors' integrative approach runs on two levels: one is to make debate a streamlined, integral part of course activities and the other is to promote both short-term learning and long-term goals of cultivating critical thinking and an inquisitive mind. Some evidence from the survey tends to substantiate the authors' expectations about short-term goals. Students found the debate format helpful in their learning and understanding of course material, improving comprehension of economic problems and issues, and reported that it enabled them see the relevance of economics. Their assessments of long-term objectives, although broadly favorable, were less consistent."

Obvious benefits accrue in using teams, but so do numerous problems. One of the main issues is that many business faculty often place students in teams with little or no guidance on how teams properly function. In this article, the author synthesizes a detailed review of the literature on teams and teamwork, examining the benefits and problems of using student teams and then suggests processes business faculty can put in place to maximize the benefits of group projects, while minimizing the problems. A preliminary study of student perceptions of team projects is also included in this review."

The Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) accreditation standards also include a commitment to diversity. In California, as well as in some other states, preferential treatment in admissions to bring about a diverse student body is against the law, which may be problematic for some universities (Golden, 2003). Many schools have struggled with this dilemma of developing diversity in the campus population. In this article, the authors examine diversity in the student body, and the role of recruitment, retention, and relationship building. The authors propose a conceptual model for successfully enhancing student diversity. They also present the implementation of the model developed at a California university and discuss the benefits of the study to the students as well as the employers."

This study shows how students' average high school grades and a range of other factors are regressed on the students' grade performance at regular half-year intervals during their participation in the program. The author applies a bootstrapping procedure to analyze changes in the regression estimators over time and finds that the magnitude of the coefficients on high school grades decreases over the 2-year period, and this decline is statistically significant. Nevertheless, high-school grades remain the most important predictors of the students' performance throughout the period studied here."

Although the goal appears to be laudable, it is not always clear how to go about achieving it. In this article, the authors describe active learning experiences in a course on business negotiations that serve the dual purpose of teaching students to negotiate and sharpen their critical-thinking skills. In the current atmosphere of resource constraints, it is unlikely that separate courses can be set up for improving critical-thinking skills. A course on business negotiations, suitably designed to incorporate appropriate active-learning experiences, is one way to promote higher order thinking skills."

The sample was a group of 864 business and economics students in United Arab Emirates. The authors used regression analysis for the study. The results of the study showed that students who participated in class discussions and who were on leave from their jobs outperformed other students. Missing many lectures and living in a crowded household negatively affected student performance. The results of the study also showed that nonnational students outperformed national students, and female students outperformed their male counterparts."

The model links variables at least partially controllable by faculty in a classroom setting to students' behavioral intentions to use teamwork skills. The authors empirically tested the theoretical model. The results show that vicarious team experience and team member support significantly affected team conflict self-efficacy. Team conflict self-efficacy influenced career outcome expectancy and current team outcome expectancy. Both outcome expectancies affected behavioral intentions to use team skills in a significant way. The authors also discussed the pedagogical implications of the results."

In this study, the author examined the evolution in electronic commerce programs offered by AACSB-accredited colleges and universities from 2001 to 2005. Although these programs are declining in number, they provide the necessary skills and knowledge required in today's digital economy. The findings of this study suggest that the essential skills and knowledge included in these programs have changed little over the periods examined. The author has provided profiles of the skills and knowledge included in master of business administration (MBA) and bachelor's programs in electronic commerce on the basis of the 2005 curricula."

However, few groups have consulted accounting academics about the purpose, structure, or content of the accounting curriculum. In this article, the author offers a suggestion for the design of the undergraduate accounting core with an emphasis on fundamental skills rather than the technical orientation featured in many programs. The suggested curriculum can operate within existing general education and business core requirements. It is organized in six levels: careers in accounting, essential skills, accounting foundations, service learning, specialization, and the role of accounting in society."

To illustrate the application of this framework, the author discusses a course sequence that could be applied in a 4-year undergraduate degree program in ERP. The ERP technical knowledge framework provides an excellent starting point for IS instructors who attempt to expand their ERP courses or create a complete ERP program that will meet the needs of the industry."

These policies include salary, promotion, vacation, tuition reimbursement, sick leave, medical insurance, life insurance, maternity or paternity leave, eldercare leave, discriminatory leave, and company support and counseling. The authors examined the students' attitudes concerning benefits and leave policies in the workplace. A one-way analysis of variance revealed that vacation leave, sick leave, and family leave involving children were more important to women than to men. A Wilcoxon rank sum test ranked family leave as the Number 1 benefit for both men and women."

They describe the design and implementation of courses in 2 different schools at the master of business administration (MBA) and undergraduate levels. Both courses involved schematic models in the teaching methodologies, but each emphasized a different model for analysis and synthesis. The Customer Value Funnel (CVF) was an innovative strategic tool used to find competitive advantage. Major strengths of this framework were simplicity, pragmatics, and an interfunctional perspective. The vertically tiered value chain was a supply chain network adaptation of M. Porter's (1985) horizontal value chain. This model enabled students to creatively consider activities that could be implemented in the organization and the supply chain members' firms to create value."

In this article, the authors explore the recruitment practices of business and the curricula of MBA programs comparing general MBA degrees with MBA degrees with specialization. The authors empirically examine whether employers prefer a general MBA or an MBA with a specialization. On the basis of an analysis of 758 employment advertisements and 27 MBA programs being offered by universities, the authors found a disconnection between what employers appeared to want and what business schools offered."

Yet, several textbook authors go further to state that EPS can be used to make comparisons among firms. In this article, the authors show that although EPS comparisons among large publicly traded companies may be appropriate, such comparisons should not be made among small publicly traded firms because the number of common shares outstanding represents a poor scaling measure for entity size. As such, accounting professors should refrain from teaching EPS as a tool for making intercompany performance comparisons or at the very least should warn students of the pitfalls of making such comparisons."

Although the ranking provided useful measures of quality, the high rank of some schools was partly due to the quality of incoming students and educational resources rather than the ability of the school to add value. In this article, the authors derive a statistical frontier with alternative reranking of schools on the basis of value added. The authors ranked some schools high according to both measures, but other schools experienced a major increase in rank when the value-added adjustment was applied. The authors discussed implications for students, parents, and business schools."

Although 1st-tier schools and colleges of business generally resolved accreditation issues long ago, other institutions are increasingly considering specialized accreditation as a strategic tool in the competition for students and institutional prestige. In this article, the authors examine the roots of this trend and propose possible implications in terms of accreditation, faculty, and funding for regional state universities and smaller institutions maintaining affiliation with churches or other religious organizations. The authors suggest several key considerations for decision makers, including the possibility that some institutions will be unable to continue to offer studies in business education."

They have advocated service learning in business as a method to implement course concepts and increase student understanding of the external environment. In this article, the author briefly summarizes institutional and program characteristics that are associated with successful service-learning programs. She reviews research publications related to service-learning implementations in business. The author found that the fields of information systems, management, and marketing have more service-learning applications tied to course-earning objectives than have the fields of accounting and finance. Further, she suggests that service learning may fit best in business courses where skilled interaction with users is a key learning goal."

However, many business employees, including recent college graduates, have serious writing deficiencies, especially in their ability to use standard English. As a result, American businesses spend billions of dollars annually to remediate these writing deficiencies (College Board, the National Commission on Writing for America's Families, Schools, and Colleges, 2004). In this article, the authors examine possible reasons for these deficiencies and offer evidence that a modified context-based approach, the glossing approach, and consistent error marking can reduce the number of sentence-level errors students make."

However, little attention has been paid to defining these concepts. As a result, they have become buzzwords that are used so frequently that their meanings are often taken for granted but are not fully understood. In this article, the author reviews the evolution of these concepts in business literature and provides comprehensive definitions, conceptual models, and examples to help clarify and distinguish the concepts so that failures of communication can be avoided."

She examines 3 learning goals: management-specific knowledge, problem solving, and communication. The results strongly suggest that the AOL activities for the management-specific knowledge-learning goal occur at the major level. However, program-level AOL activities are appropriate for the communication-learning goal. The evidence, although inconclusive, indicates the need for AOL activities related to the problem-solving learning goal at the major level."

Student participants (125 women, 132 men) rated the stimulus person on indexes of attractiveness, trustworthiness, credibility, and likeability. Style of dress and form of address resulted in significant differences in ratings of the professor's trustworthiness, expertise, and likeability. The authors also found significant Gender x Style of Dress and Gender x Form of Address interactions. Suggestions for future researchers include the use of additional stimulus person information and the inclusion of independent variables such as professor approachability, willingness of students to confide in professors, and students' willingness to participate in classroom discussions."

Most textbooks focus on presenting individual concepts or tools and fail to address complex issues confronted in real-world problem-solving situations. The supplementary use of cases does not help students to understand the dynamic challenges that professionals encounter in organizational settings. In this article, the authors describe an approach used to direct students through Six Sigma process improvement projects at local companies to reinforce the students' classroom experience. These projects provide excellent tools for enhancing learning and strengthening the bonds between universities and business communities."

The author measured business students' intended behavior for 4 hypothetical unethical situations by investigating the following determinants: belief toward the behavior, subjective norms (i.e., pressure), perceived behavioral control, perceived personal outcome (i.e., benefit), and perceived social acceptance by others. In an expanded intention model, belief was consistently the most powerful predictor of intent in all 4 situations. Perceived behavioral control, perceived personal outcome, and perceived social acceptance by others were moderately good predictors of intent. Subjective norms was the weakest predictor of intent. Assessing students' intended unethical behavior has implications for educators."

The author (a) used exploratory data analysis to determine the topics that AIS courses most frequently offered and (b) used descriptive statistics and econometric analysis to trace the diversity of course topics through time, complementing previous literature on the topic by providing an alternative research methodology. The results indicate an increase in topical diversity and an emphasis on data modeling and AIS design and development, evident in both the course topics offered and the choice of software in these AIS courses. These findings (a) provide a reference for faculty whom administrators have tasked with designing AIS curricula and (b) serve as a basis for considering the state of accounting education, the relevance of information systems, and the evolving role of the accountant."

However, relatively few business schools (only 168 at the time of the present study) had separate accounting accreditation. The authors compared CPA exam performance of candidates from AACSB-accredited business-only programs with that of candidates from nonaccredited programs. The authors also compared candidate performance from programs accredited by 2 alternative business-school-accrediting organizations with nonaccredited programs.

Business schools have responded to the mandate with attempts to integrate discipline-specific functional knowledge into a coherent understanding of the evolving business organization. Successful integration of the undergraduate business curriculum will result in students who are more directly involved in the learning process and will increase curricular relevance by translating functional knowledge into business skills. However, curriculum integration is an extensive and potentially disruptive curricular change that may involve cost and is fraught with pitfalls. The authors surveyed deans at member schools of the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business International to assess the extent to which and the manner in which integration has taken place within the business curriculum."

As the authors hypothesized, groups differed in their views of the dilemmas presented. The results did not support a 2nd hypothesis predicting a linear relationship between academic achievement of respondent groups and their ethical responses. The authors expected that as respondents gained more exposure to ethical perspectives through further education, they would respond accordingly, supporting a correlation effect. Despite significant differences between groups in their assessments of the dilemmas, situational differences other than educational attainment appeared to be most influential. The authors discussed implications, which raised doubt about whether teaching ethics enhances ethical behavior."

The author reports on the development of a unique multiattributes approach for objectively ranking PhD programs. The advantage of this approach is an inherently broader consideration for the indicators of quality and reputation of a program as measured by the accomplishments of its graduates. By combining multiple attributes into a ranking metric, this approach emphasizes research quality that is in line with the recommendation stated by the AACSB (2003). Also, because the multiattributes approach incorporates data that is readily available, PhD program rankings can be more efficiently updated annually."

In 2 scenario studies based on actual grading techniques, the authors examined perceptions of fair assessment. Participants were undergraduate students from 2 universities. A theoretical model of procedural justice provided the background. Results indicate that 3 objective aspects of grading?explicitness of grading criteria, frequency of feedback, and proactiveness of instructor techniques?affect perceived fairness."

Leading-edge corporations are using business analytics to achieve competitive advantage. However, educators are not adequately preparing business school students in quantitative methods to meet this challenge. For more than half a century, business schools have relied mostly on a course in calculus and a course in statistics to meet the needs of their students despite an information-based business climate that has changed significantly. The authors propose that educators prepare students in the areas of mathematical modeling and risk management and quantitative skills, teaching them in the context of meaningful business problems."

The results show that although businesses and business schools essentially agree on the competencies that identify successful managers and graduates, business schools do not emphasize these competencies in their curricula. Because one of the main goals of business schools is to prepare their graduates for managerial careers after graduation, these results suggest that business schools should do more to align their curricula with the desires of businesses."

The new type of case study, named the real-time case (RTC) study, uses the Internet to bring business reality to business courses and to facilitate communication among faculty, students, and the case company. In the present study, data from student surveys provided an assessment of RTC. The author's analysis suggests that the RTC concept engages and satisfies students at a higher level than do average courses and presents a more realistic and integrated view of business decision making. However, the level of satisfaction declined in comparison with the first iteration of RTC in 2001 (S. House & J. Theroux). In the present study, the author presents student feedback to explain the difference."

Using a logistic regression analysis, the author also examined 8 factors that could potentially influence students' ethicality. Results indicate 6 scenarios related to 5 areas of the code that deserve special attention and increasing course coverage. These 5 areas of concern are (a) failure to report unethical behavior, (b) improper use of company assets, (c) conflict of interest, (d) inaccurate accounting records by way of channel stuffing (offering a deep discount to customers to overbuy), and (e) trading on inside information. Regression analysis results suggest that female gender, accounting major, full-time work experience, and the number of workplace ethics trainings have a positive influence on students' ethicality. These results should help educators and corporate ethics trainers direct more attention to students or entry-level personnel with these characteristics."

Although gender inequity persists in today's workplace, its presence and effects continue to be underestimated by the relevant stakeholders. Informal observations have shown that college students consider themselves immune to gender discrimination. The authors sought to ascertain students' perceptions of anticipated gender discrimination. Findings suggest that students perceive gender discrimination as being of little consequence, and that they are likely to enter a gender-neutral workplace. These perceptions could have negative effects on organizations and employees, but education can be used to minimize these consequences."

This issue is important to the 156 schools and colleges currently seeking initial accreditation by AACSB and to the thousands of schools worldwide that could seek accreditation. Although the changes in the AACSB accreditation standards opened the door to many smaller teaching-oriented schools, the revised standards may induce schools with limited resources to seek accreditation. The authors identify significant costs in becoming accredited and a considerable increase in annual operating costs to maintain accreditation. The 10 schools in the present study experienced 1-time initial expenditures and increased annual expenses. Business school deans and university administrators need to be aware of the initial costs of accreditation along with the increased annual costs."

L. Holland's (1985) vocational theory and investigated whether the 2 groups differed on the Big Five model of personality (B. De Raad, 2000; agreeableness, conscientiousness, emotional stability, extraversion, openness) and 4 narrow personality traits. For business majors, the authors also examined the relations between personality traits and life satisfaction. Business majors scored higher for conscientiousness, emotional stability, extraversion, assertiveness, and tough-mindedness, but they scored lower on agreeableness and openness. All of the traits except for agreeableness and tough-mindedness correlated significantly and positively with life satisfaction. The authors discuss results in terms of similar relations in business occupations and support of vocational theory."

This realization has led employers to expect and demand that business schools facilitate the training of students in ethics and social responsiblity. However, research is mixed on how well business schools are responding to these pressures. In the present study the authors assessed curriculum coordinators' (e.g., department chairs', program administrators') perceptions of the level of inclusion of ethics and social responsibility at the level of specific programs and majors. The authors suggest that there is a perceived deficiency in the degree of integration of ethics and social responsibility into various specific disciplines.

This is because success in publishing connects closely with universities' decisions on tenure and promotion and with opportunities for merit-based pay increases and alternative employment. The purpose of the present study was to examine the characteristics of published articles by the most productive authors of accounting literature with particular attention to levels of collaboration. The results indicate that prolific authors of accounting literature become more productive and produce longer articles by working with others. However, such prolific authors appear to decrease the number of coauthors on their higher quality publications, possibly to increase the quality of their reputation. From these findings, the present authors derive implications for faculty and provide concluding comments."

The primary objective of the present research study is to test the hypothesis that ethical coverage in accounting programs is an important factor in recruiting decisions for entry-level accounting positions. The research was conducted in two phases. The first phase employed an experimental design to test whether ethical coverage in accounting programs is an important factor in recruiting decisions for entry-level accounting positions. The second phase employed a survey, allowing recruiters to self-report which criteria they value most in recruiting for entry-level accountant positions. The results from both phases suggest that ethical coverage in accounting programs in not an important factor in recruiting decisions for entry-level accounting positions."

However, previous studies have lacked conceptual and methodological focus on market-based dimensions of financial literacy. We hypothesize that male and female college students respond differently to perceptions of threat emanating from financial markets. Findings from an exploratory test suggested that female college students were more intimidated by, and less interested in, markets compared with their male counterparts. Women also possessed lower levels of financial market awareness. These findings persisted after controlling for numerous demographic factors, suggesting a latent factor that may uniquely account for a significant amount of affective and cognitive diversity."

Respondents in the survey were 141 deans of Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) accredited business schools in the United States and 71 heads of Australian commerce programs. Overall, student field-based consultancy is widely used in both countries. This indicates that it should be possible to implement international field-based consultancies between American and Australian business schools, which would, in turn, lead to increased potential for international study abroad for business students of both countries."

The authors contacted 137 member schools offering accounting masters degrees. Only one school required an international trip as a curriculum component, and 36 (26.3%) schools included an optional international trip. The remaining 100 schools (approximately 73%) did not include an international trip in their graduate accounting curriculum. Survey results suggest that accounting educators have made little progress toward internationalization of the accounting curriculum beyond integration of international topics into existing courses or the addition of stand-alone international courses."

The authors collected data from 152 students at two schools. Students at one school supported the requirement while those at the other school did not. However, students believed that the 150-hr requirement enhances the quality of certified public accountants (CPAs) and results in better prepared CPA candidates. On the other hand, many students were concerned with the opportunity cost associated with securing additional hours. Students were most interested in additional undergraduate courses in accounting and business, preferably offered via a double major or minor, to meet the requirement. Students rated the Master's in Accountancy as the preferred graduate degree."

A second experiment helped explain these findings. Results from Experiment 2 suggest students with higher GPAs responded to the inferred meaning of framed messages; that is, they looked beyond the literal message to find the message intended."

As the baby-boom generation approaches retirement, the supply of available replacement faculty members is diminishing. The result is a competitive market for replacement faculty that features increasing starting salary levels. In particular, faculty lines that have been occupied for extended time periods need to be marked to market salary levels because annual salary increases rarely keep pace with inflation in the labor market. The authors report the results of a national survey to determine the amount of salary premium required to bring vacated management faculty lines back up to competitive market levels. As business schools struggle to replace retiring and departing faculty, budgets have to account for these premium increases to succeed in an increasingly competitive market for faculty labor."

The sample, which was used to test the developed hypotheses, included 312 students whose performance was followed throughout 3 semesters (4, 6, and 8) out of 8. Techniques of mean comparison and correlation were employed. The results suggest that the preuniversity accounting background was only found to have significant impact on the AMA course whereas skill in mathematics was found to affect student performance significantly in the MA course. It was evidenced that student performance in the MA course and overall was significantly affected by preuniversity ability, general undergraduate academic capability, and matriculation year. Student performance in the Financial Accounting course significantly correlated with performance in the subsequent MA and AMA courses. There is also evidence of a significant relationship between MA student performance and that of both CA and AMA. The findings of this study confirmed that the load of weekly registered hours has no negative impact on the student performance. It also suggested that accounting students had outperformed nonaccounting students in accounting and nonaccounting courses."

Data analysis showed that these individuals, who reported high job involvement and strong career planning, were often stymied when they attempted to apply new ideas to the workplace. Those with strong social and family support reported feeling less stress than did those who did not, and preferred learning experiences in which they were active learners. Results from this exploratory study show that when individual characteristics, the academic environment, and the workplace environment are in alignment, individuals are most supported in becoming all they can be."

Although many teachers are devoted to a learning-centered approach, others signal by their actions a deep-set interest in grading. The authors used a 2 ? 2 matrix to analyze potential matches and mismatches between teacher orientation and student orientation. The implications of the mismatches are discussed. The authors suggest dealing with the dilemma by making learning and grading mutually supportive, thus creating a more effective learning environment."

The experiment was conducted on three groups using learning strategy application as between participant's factors. The means of the scores from pre- and posttests were analyzed using the student t test. No significant difference was found between the groups for the pretest; however, both treatment groups performed significantly better in the posttest than did the control group. The findings support the literature that mnemonic devices can accelerate the rate at which new information is acquired and improve formal reasoning. A model is introduced for assessing the characteristics which affect memory recall."

Higher business education plays an important role in preparing students to assume the knowledge management and human resource roles so necessary to organizations. The authors examined the relationship between knowledge management, human resource management, and typical knowledge learning goals of an accredited business education program. A theoretical model is presented, illustrating how these relationships might overlap. The model proposes a linkage between knowledge management tenets, human resource management activities in organizations, and Bloom's Revised Taxonomy for planning and evaluating educational goals."

This coupled with an increase in academic misbehavior among both high school and university students has provided an opportunity to scrutinize the effects of narcissism on attitudes toward academic dishonesty. The authors investigated this relationship and the presence of intervening variables such as academic entitlement and exploitativeness. The results indicate that the relationship between narcissism and academic dishonesty may be mediated by exploitative attitudes."

Four cultural differences were hypothesized to contribute to overall less ethical decisions of Chinese students. The results support the hypothesis and indicate strong cultural effects on 5 areas of the code: (a) accurate accounting records, (b) proper use of company assets, (c) compliance with laws, (d) trading on inside information, and (e) reporting unethical behavior. Business educators and corporate ethics trainers should be aware of these cultural effects, and provide more coverage and special emphasis on these areas when they have Chinese students or entry-level personnel."

Furthermore, the opportunity cost of administering these exams at the institution in question exceeds $25,000 annually. The authors argue that the cost-benefit tradeoff of the ETSB exit exam is unfavorable."

Results showed that educators and students agreed that IS curricula had the appropriate emphasis on many of the communication skills. However, the two groups significantly differed on their extent of agreement or disagreement with appropriate level of emphasis and the number of courses that cover such communication skills. Results revealed that educators felt there were a few communication skills, such as proofreading, listening, facilitating meetings, and using interpersonal skills with external customers and management, that needed more emphasis in the IS curriculum. Implications for educators and researchers are reported."

The consistency of these rankings suggests either the best programs have the most productive faculty, or that the university affiliations most often seen in publications are correlated with institutional quality, which biases the rankings towards larger programs. The authors introduce a per capita measure of research output to evaluate finance programs in a context that removes absolute size as a variable. The results indicate that smaller programs in the field are frequently overlooked in traditional rankings."

The author sheds light on the attitudinal states of the MBA students who occupy those many seats, engage in class discussions, analyze cases, and finally are knighted as Masters of the Universe. Quite surprisingly, MBA students have diverse attitudes toward the business community. In a sample of 866 MBA students representing 27 MBA programs around the United States, the research suggests that these students do not embrace all aspects of business practices. Students are biased, skeptical and, on certain issues, downright critical of the community they are about to join."

Correlation, stepwise regression, and multiple least squares regression were used to create a statistically significant model with 4 interaction factors that captured 89% of adjusted variance effect on grade. Although factor multicollinearity was excessive, the model supported a hypothesis that more student interaction in all 4 discussion forums predicted a higher grade. Certain types of asynchronous forums presented negative factor coefficients, which implied too much interaction may be counterproductive (cognitive load theory or the law of diminishing returns)."

Students reported prior experience with computer technology, their ideal classroom instruction techniques, and what technology-enhanced pedagogies they anticipated in college classrooms. Although student desires have changed, the picture of an ideal classroom still shows a strong desire for lecture-dominated classes with class discussion and exercises, written handouts, and outlines. Implications and suggestions for future research are included."

Changing student demographics and the lack of a statistical framework are two of the most vexing issues confronting educators when using the MFT-B for programmatic assessment. The authors extended the literature by developing an analytical framework that controls for student demographics and provides statistically valid evidence of outcomes assessment. Application of the model to a sample data set revealed that the model fit well (R 2 = .517) and provides a valid framework for the exploration of outcomes assessment."

Previous studies that ranked institutions for editorial board representation focused on journals that primarily favor publication of basic and applied research contributions. As a result, prior research has accorded either very minimal or no consideration for journals that publish learning and pedagogical research. This author addressed the aforementioned shortcoming by extending the editorial board ranking method to include 1,279 editorial board affiliations for 31 business education journals. The rankings provide a comparative perspective on institutional affiliations and participation in the peer review process for business education research."

Cognitive, affective, and behavioral dimensions were measured before and after participating in the curriculum. Older high school students increased their attitudes toward cooperatives more than did younger students. Students with prior exposure to cooperatives had increases in positive attitudes toward cooperatives. Larger increases were increased in positive attitudes in female students than male students. Finally, students in regions of North Dakota with relatively fewer cooperatives per square mile had larger increases in positive attitudes."

Students receive the benefits of working with large data sets and real-world problems. However, with the advent of network and wireless connections, students can now use the computer for alternating tasks, such as emailing, web browsing, and social networking. Do these distractions diminish the benefits of the computers? An experiment was conducting comparing exam scores in two different classes, one class held in a traditional classroom and another class taught in a computer lab classroom. Holding constant other factors such as student's ability and demographics, the results show a small negative effect from conducting class in a computer equipped classroom."

However, the influence of letting students self-select the percentage weights for graded course components is not clear. In this research students selected the percentage weights distribution for the graded components in the Capstone: Strategic Management course. Students were then surveyed to solicit their feedback. The results indicate that student sense of control and performance were positively influenced by self-selecting the weights distribution. Moreover, the self-selection process itself may account for variance in performance more so than calculating final course grades using a particular weights distribution."

The authors focus on the suitability of online delivery for quantitative business courses, specifically business statistics and management science. They use multiple approaches to assess student learning. Their findings suggest that features involving professor?student interaction are the most useful, features promoting student?student interaction are the least useful, and discussion forums are of limited value in learning quantitative content. The authors also illustrate how questions embedded in an online final exam can be used to measure desired student learning outcomes."

However, a great deal of concern about the high costs of college textbooks has been expressed by those inside and outside of higher education. The authors focus on the results of a pilot study of a survey of marketing professors? criteria and use of textbooks and their reactions to some of the changes that have been implemented or may be implemented by universities, state legislatures, and publishers to combat these cost escalations. Findings indicate that respondents appear to have strong resistance to university, legislative, and publisher actions that infringe on their options in selecting textbooks and how long they would have to use a specific textbook before replacing it with a newer edition. This was particularly true of a university policy requiring low-cost textbooks be adopted, requiring instructors to keep textbooks for all classes for at least 3 years, requiring publishers to send an invoice after a 30-day review period, and requiring sending only 1 examination per department. There were also significant differences among respondents based on a t test and analysis of variance. Basically, those who had more teaching experience (11 or more years) were opposed to any legislation or university policy about publishers releasing cost data or requiring the use of the lowest cost text. They also ranked the importance of content higher than their counterparts."

The Educational Testing Service, publisher of the assessment, provides data that allow institutions to compare their own MFT-B performance to national norms, but that procedure fails to take the characteristics of institutional student cohorts into account. Using empirical methods, the authors describe and test a procedure to set a priori goals that take dispositional factors, most notably ACT scores, into account. This procedure enables interpretation of the MFT-B in relation to expectations."

The technique offers an additional tool to the growing literature on active and collaborative learning. Given a short timeframe, students are required to investigate, analyze, or solve problems assigned by the instructor. This brief critical thinking phase is followed by group presentations in which the students must support their arguments and teach others about relevant course concepts. The traditional idea of learning by teaching serves as the foundational principle behind this approach. Various ways of employing impromptu presentations in the classroom are also described. Finally, the merits of the impromptu presentation approach are highlighted by drawing on the active learning, peer teaching, and levels of learning literature streams."

Additionally, performance in undergraduate written composition is positively correlated with MBA GPA. Moreover, performance in undergraduate marketing, economics, and business statistics courses are significant predictors of MBA GPA. Finally, the authors found undergraduate GPA predicted MBA success."

Furthermore, the competencies reveal the necessity of a skill set that transcends typical disciplinary divisions?encompassing technology, intergroup relations, nonverbal and chronemic awareness, relational competence, and more. These competencies should be of interest to communication educators and trainers as they design curriculum and training plans for a contemporary audience."

A total of 273 institutions were surveyed and 99 institutions were included in the final study population. The results show that 5 out of 8 master of science in information systems (MSIS) 2006 courses are required by less than 50% of institutions, but a descriptive model of the core of IS master's programs differs from MSIS 2006 by only one course. It is also found that the widely required core courses have not changed over the past 10 years. The results suggest that in the dynamic field of IS, institutions may have converged upon a set of IS core courses that they deem as essential to their graduates."

Little if any scholarship exists about students and recent graduates from undergraduate business programs specifically, so the topic is explored here. Included are patterns among the majors and emphases in business programs, and a logit model with choice of business major as the dependent variable. Findings include the odds are greater a student will choose business as a major if the student is a man, has parents with lower levels of education, has higher family income, had a higher GPA in high school, and did not earn advanced placement credit in high school. The findings show there are differences in the behavior of female and male students regarding choice of business major."

The authors used data from a study conducted with undergraduate students in management courses to examine student preferences of group work evaluation approaches and their perceptions about fairness, workload, and due process for each approach. The findings suggest that students prefer a confidential questionnaire to conduct peer evaluations and perceive it to be the fairest approach, although also reducing concerns for evaluating shared workload. However, there was evidence that student perceptions of due process in approaches without an instructor's involvement were lower."

Data were collected from Qatari educational institutions with SPSS used in performing the analysis. It assessed awareness, understanding, benefits, and progress of TQM implementation based on the 11 critical success factors (CSFs) or essential elements developed in the revisited model of leverage points for a total quality culture transformation. The strongest driving force toward TQM was teamwork while the strongest restraining force was lack of knowledge of TQM principles and its associated tools. The analysis concluded that although there was a low level of TQM implementation, the dominant perception of TQM in general was positive where a culture toward collective consciousness or teamwork was beginning to be accepted within private and semigovernment educational institutions in Qatar. The findings would be of a particular interest to private and public educational institutions; especially those that intend to initiate TQM and accreditation within their institutions in the Middle East."

Using data on student performance in four typical intermediate business courses?Intermediate Microeconomics, Intermediate Macroeconomics, Intermediate Business Statistics, and Intermediate Financial Accounting I?the authors found that average student performance in these courses is essentially completely determined by the underlying academic quality of the student, as measured by grade point average. Where they take their lower level prerequisite courses, and what letter grade they earn in those courses, do not generally play a significant role."

Presently, business ranks as one of the most popular undergraduate majors on American college campuses, awarding over 20% of all undergraduate degrees granted each year. Despite its popularity, many people question whether these students receive the type of education needed to effectively compete in a rapidly changing world. The authors report the findings of an extensive study of undergraduate business curricula in the United States, the results of which suggest that very little has changed since the Ford and Carnegie Foundations Reports were published in 1959. The authors conclude with some suggestions on how to improve business education for future graduates."

The Anatomy of a Scan rubric resolves two problems associated with environmental scanning instruction. First, the need for simpler rubric designs with familiar formats arises because digital knowledge economy intelligence exceeds the capabilities of existing scanning rubrics, given business education course delivery constraints. Second, the need for improved economic information literacy arises because knowledge economy dynamics expand the breadth and depth of digital market intelligence. By using economic market intelligence to anchor environmental scanning, the anatomy rubric improves students? strategic focus with conceptual advantages and raises economic literacy with empirical application."

They developed a correlation model linking the strength of personality preferences in the KTS-II to academic performance by students who were enrolled in the managerial accounting course at a large public university in Maryland. There were 109 undergraduate business students who participated. The authors found that individuals with certain personality traits (nonguardian and intuitive types) performed better in managerial accounting tasks than guardian and sensing types. They anticipated these results because nonguardian and intuitive types have personality traits that are considered necessary for a successful career in management accounting."

The main objective was to assess whether there is a place for service learning projects and how they should be integrated into the program. A combination of two surveys were used, one taken before the project and one after. Reflection papers were also analyzed. The findings revealed the effectiveness of service learning in making business students not only aware, but also sensitive to poverty in a developing country. As a result, students may approach business decisions with a greater understanding of their impact on poverty and society."

The Case of an Upper-Division Business Core Class","Denise Stanley",2013,"Journal of Education for Business","5d517657-b151-358a-8b2f-bc9ccea586d7",NA,"Larger classes are often associated with lower student achievement. The author tested the hypothesis that the introduction of personal response systems significantly improves scores in a 250-seat classroom, through the channels of improved attendance and engagement. She focused on how continuous participation with the technology could change learning results. The author found that overall attendance rose when the response system was introduced. Regression results show student exam performance during the semester with technology was improved significantly by I-Clicker points per session rather than attendance, while the reverse holds true regarding unannounced quizzes."

Data were collected from 516 students enrolled in a junior-level required business course. Controlling for students? grade point average, stepwise regression showed a significant relationship between scholarly discussion board usage and both group and individual grades. Students who read the discussion board improved their final grade. More importantly, those students who posted to the discussion board showed further improvement in their academic performance. The findings strongly support the critical notion that when discussion board activity is structured, scholarly networking leads to better student performance. This should encourage more faculty to incorporate task-oriented online discussion in their courses."

The results showed that there is a significant positive correlation between team satisfaction and group performance only for the American students. Demographic factors such as gender, employment, course level, course subject, and group gender were partially significant in influencing students? responses. American students performed better than Qatari students, but they were less satisfied with their team members. These differences may be attributed to the cultural dissimilarities between the American and the Qatari students; thus, students? cultural backgrounds should be considered when forming groups."

Using faculty survey data collected from 320 faculty members at 10 business schools, they found that faculty members, both men and women, who displayed higher motivation were more productive in research. Among them, pretenured faculty were motivated by extrinsic rewards; conversely, posttenured faculty were motivated by intrinsic rewards. Gender differences were observed in faculty's overall and intrinsic motivations. Specifically, female faculty displayed higher overall and intrinsic motivations than male faculty, and such a gender difference was especially profound between posttenured female and male faculty. Faculty members, both men and women, considered receiving tenure and promotiosn to be the most important research motivations. Other important motivational factors included salary raises, satisfying a need for creativity?curiosity, and staying current."

The findings suggest that even when students are satisfied with the text, they are not likely to read the text as often as suggested, nor are they likely to use the supplemental materials (i.e., break out boxes, cases, and exercises) made available to them. Students do, however, demonstrate a preference toward PowerPoint slides over textbooks for class information. The authors propose several explanations for these behaviors, including the proliferation of information technology and new teaching pedagogies."

Responses are also compared to small samples of faculty and certified public accountant firm recruiters. The computer skills examined are accounting software, databases, e-mail or Internet, programming, spreadsheets, and word processing. Students believe that grade point averages and all 6 computer skills are important. Faculty and recruiters believe all skills are important except programming skills. Differences exist based on audit versus tax and on gender. Spreadsheet skills are by far the most important."

The results indicate limited visibility of MS as a discipline and significant variation in MS topic coverage across institutions. These findings raise serious concerns about the ability of business schools to produce future graduates with the skills needed to support industry adoption of advanced analytics."

The authors? research is based on a sample of 442 undergraduate business students enrolled in marketing classes at two different universities. Students? creativity was assessed using a creativity scale that measured ways of thinking in six different areas. The authors compared creativity scores of different business majors in each of these six dimensions and found that contrary to earlier research findings, students in the quantitative business disciplines of accounting, finance, economics, and information systems outperformed other business majors in some categories of creative thinking. Specific recommendations are presented to include training in a greater variety of dimensions of creative thinking in the business curriculum."

However, business schools have not required their tools to be empirically validated, thus ensuring that they measure what they are intended to measure. The authors propose confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) be utilized by business schools to evaluate AoL measurement systems. They illustrate a CFA model used to evaluate the measurement tools at their college. The authors? approach is in its initial steps, currently evaluating individual measurement tools, but the authors are working toward developing a system that can evaluate the entire AoL measurement system."

The authors present an original exercise that introduces three key concepts in negotiation: best alternative to a negotiated agreement, distributive bargaining, and integrative bargaining. They review these concepts and present the exercise and its purpose, and execution, then debrief. A unique feature of the exercise is that instructors can configure dynamic buyer?seller dyads with varying distributions of power between parties. A pre- and posttest using four questions to assess learning with Master of Business Administration students and undergraduates suggest that the exercise is an effective teaching tool."

The COB developed and offered an online, noncredit review course to help students prepare for the Major Field Test in Business (MFT). Early results demonstrated the efficacy of the course as student scores rose from the 40th percentile to the 65th percentile. The authors analyze stage 4 data to determine the relationship between the online review and MFT performance. Results suggest the impact of the online review course diminishes as overall performance increases. Assessment outcomes may be influenced by the number of Hispanic and international students taking the MFT."

Loyalty to a business school's values and need to differentiate lead one to reflect on the actions undertaken within the institution and how they align with the business school's aims. This article contributes to this issue through what is called strategic alignment, which is the coherence between learning goals and teaching methods on the one hand, and the institution's educational aims on the other. It was hypothesized that designing a methodological teaching model aligned with those aims will result in students perceiving differentiation at the same time that the teaching methodology improves. Findings confirm these hypotheses."

Previous studies revealed that factors such as prior ability, age, gender, and culture predicted a student's Major Field Test in Business (MFTB) score better than course content. The experiment control consisted of identical syllabi and faculty (except for the treatment). The analysis of covariance results were statistically significant (n = 134) with a 40% effect size (and a 74% effect size using multiple regression). The study demonstrated that cognitive learning strategies (accounting for gender and course level grade point average) can influence a student's MFTB exam score. An analysis of covariance can be used to accurately measure student learning gain regardless of prior ability."

This failure has prompted business educators to rethink the role of neoclassical economics as the foundation of business education. The author connects this question to the more general critique of the scientific model of business education and the old historical versus scientific methodology debate in the history of economics. It is argued that neoclassical economics has serious limitations that make it a poor foundation for understanding business behavior in a real economy. A realistic and useful business education needs to include historical and social context, both of which neoclassical economics must exclude."

The analysis extends prior research by investigating the incremental information content of individual components from one admission test conditional on the information contained in the other admission test and undergraduate grade point average. The results suggest that for international applicants in master of accountancy programs, the TOEFL test is the only one that yields statistically significant incremental information content about academic success. If admissions officers were to eliminate one of the tests, it should not be the TOEFL."

The authors find that students with higher cumulative grade point averages (GPAs) are more likely to take the test. Additionally, students are more likely to take the test if it is offered late in the semester. Further results indicate that students with higher GPAs tend to score better on the MFT-B, and thus the outcomes profile of a school based on MFT-B results may appear stronger than it actually is if taking the test is not a requirement of the business program."

A poster project that culminated in a professional-style poster session was assigned. Students completed a group project producing a poster describing the production process of a manufacturing company and determining the most appropriate costing system for that company with underlying reasons. Two questionnaires were conducted after each assignment in order to measure the effect of the poster project on the motivation and learning of the managerial accounting students. This pilot study is the first to explore perceptions of poster projects as a motivational and learning tool in managerial accounting courses in the world."

The primary purpose of this study was to determine what students thought employers considered important information when researching profiles. A survey was given to students enrolled in College of Business classes at a university in the Southeast. Students were cognizant that employers consider posts about drugs, alcohol, sex, profanity, and negative comments. Students did not consider posts and photo tags by friends to be important to employers, nor did they consider grammar and spelling to be important. This is in stark contrast to what recent research indicates employers consider important."

In this study the authors fill this lacuna by deploying content analysis of the textbook content and devising new measures of textbook quality that may impact their ultimate selection by accounting information systems (AIS) instructors. These novel measures are discussed in the light of textbook market share information gleaned from three sources: a survey of AIS instructors, and executives at two leading educational publishers. The authors conclude with a consideration of pedagogical policy implications of the findings."

Following K. Ritzberger's (2008) and X. Yu and Z. Gao's (2010) ranking method, the authors develop six indices to rank institutions from several aspects, including both the quantity and quality of publications. By doing so, they provide a clear viewpoint about which institutions achieve high levels of academic performance in management and business research. They also find that (a) there is still a large gap in research rankings between business schools in Mainland China and in Hong Kong; (b) some institutions perform well in quantity rankings but poorly in quality rankings; (c) the development of the general management and operation disciplines are much more mature than that of the finance and accounting disciplines in Greater China; and (d) most outstanding institutions cooperate with developed countries at a moderate level.

Topics range from general attitudes and beliefs (benefits to grades, impact on mastery of material, professors? motives) to administration (group composition, grading, peer reviews, group leadership). It was hypothesized that students act as GPA maximizers (prefer higher grades if holding all else equal) and therefore high achievers would answer many of the questions differently than low achievers. Regression results suggest that, generally, GPA better explains survey results for non-business majors than for business majors."

The instructor and instructional methodology were the same in different sections of an introductory finance class. Only the procedure in which students were tested?online versus in the classroom?differed. The authors measured student effort by tracking the number of times students accessed study resources that had been placed on the university Blackboard course management system, and performance as grades on tests given either online for some students or in the classroom for other students. The results indicate that neither study efforts nor course performance was influenced by the testing procedure. However, the authors did find a strong positive relationship between students? effort and their performance in the course."

Empirical Evidence and Policy Implications","Tin-Chun Lin",2014,"Journal of Education for Business","ff85e413-2bfe-3afa-a816-2dc76a732f28",NA,"A total of 389 business students in undergraduate introductory microeconomics classes in spring 2007, 2009, and 2011, and fall 2012 participated in an exam performance progress study. Empirical evidence suggested that missing classes decelerates and hampers high-performing students? exam performance progress. Nevertheless, the evidence does not indicate that gender is a factor in determining whether missing classes impedes students? exam performance progress. Moreover, policy implications are discussed. For faculty, a mandatory attendance policy, daily motivational quiz, and incentive-stimulating attendance strategy are suggested. For school authorities, increasing campus employment opportunities is suggested. For the government, the author suggests that Congress should annually restore the purchasing power of federal grants by increasing the maximum grant awards and lowering federal student loan rates to half of present rates, but restrictions should be added on grant recipients to ensure that better attendance behaviors are achieved."

Millenials may face three major problems in relation to management learning: lack of concentration, lack of engagement, and lack of socialization. Management learning at the speed of life addresses these potential problems through three dimensions: reflective, creative, and collaborative learning. This paper illustrates the benefits of reflective, creative, and collaborative spaces for millenials using practices from leadership and personal development courses that were offered over seven years in Canada, Turkey, and the UK. These courses incorporated the latest technology that brought the course activities up to the speed of life."

A post-test only control group experimental design was employed with a total of 235 business students enrolled in a core marketing unit – Brand &amp; Product Management – at an Australian university. Tutorial sessions across three different campuses were randomly categorised as experimental and control groups. A total of 107 students (approximately 46%) were exposed to the experimental treatment (i.e. the board game). In terms of results, an independent-samples t-test shows that students involved in playing the board game reported significantly higher levels of flow, as compared to students attending and reporting on a conventional tutorial session. Findings from this study suggest that the use of a board game to introduce a brand-related topic saw students experience greater motivation, enjoyment and absorption (i.e. a flow experience) than students in the control group. Business educators may consider experimenting with alternative teaching methods, including board games, in order to enhance students' flow during face-to-face classes."

This study adds to the increasing growing body of empirical evidence of the effectiveness of simulation games but more importantly emphasises why by explaining the instructional design implemented reflecting best practices. This multi-method study finds evidence that student learning was enhanced through the use of simulation games, reflected in the two key themes; simulation games as a catalyst for learning and simulation games as a vehicle for learning. In so doing the research provides one of the few empirically based studies that support simulation games in enhancing learning and, more importantly, contextualizes the enhancement in terms of the instructional design of the curriculum. This research should prove valuable for those with an academic interest in the use of simulation games and management educators who use, or are considering its use. Further, the findings contribute to the academic debate concerning the effective implementation of simulation game-based training in business and management education."

A question is raised here as to what extent engaging students with feedback and considering their voices as partners in the assessment process can improve their confidence and therefore their learning. The objective of this action research was to support the introduction of the Essay Feedback Checklist (EFC) to first year management students at a British University. This research examined the use of EFC as an interactive two-way communication tool between tutors and students. The research also aimed to help management students to be more aware of the assessment criteria and thus to be more engaged with their feedback. Data was collected from students and tutors before and after the use of the EFC in order to compare their attitudes towards the use of the tool. The research findings show that students found the EFC a useful tool to support engagement with the feedback and for improving their confidence to develop their work further. Tutors and students claimed that the EFC created an interactive environment in providing feedback and helped to open a dialogue about it, but they also highlighted some drawbacks."

The analysis revealed five internship impact areas, including adaptability to the workplace (AWP), team-playing capability (TPC), professionalism (PR), computer &amp; communication skills (CCS), and career potential (CP). Interns were generally satisfied with the program. They believed that the internship improved their AWP, TPC, PR, CCS, and CP. However, the intern's major influenced satisfaction as the interns majoring in accounting, finance, and management information systems (MIS) were more satisfied with their experiential learning than were their counterparts majoring in economics, management, and marketing. In addition, the year of the internship influenced the interns' satisfaction as the 2013 interns reported lower satisfaction with the improvement in their AWP, TPC, PR, and CCS than did the 2010 interns. These findings and their theoretical and practical implications are further discussed in the paper."

The authors propose a conceptualization of student engagement grounded in A. W. Astin's (1984) Student Involvement Theory and W. A. Kahn's (1990) employee engagement research where student engagement is built on four components: emotional engagement, physical engagement, cognitive engagement in class, and cognitive engagement out of class. Using this framework the authors develop and psychometrically test a student engagement survey that can be used by researchers to advance engagement theory and by business schools to monitor continuous improvement."

However, audits show that almost all complex spreadsheets have errors. The author examined textbooks to understand why responsible data analysis is taught. A purposeful sample of 10 textbooks was coded, and then compared against spreadsheet development best practices. The results show a wide range of approaches, and reveal that none of the 10 books fully cover the methodologies needed to create well-rounded Excel data analysts. There is a need to re-evaluate the teaching approaches being used in office application courses."

There were disagreements on the extent of occurrence, with the deans reporting a lower rate of occurrence than faculty. Deans also indicated less impact of undeserved authorships on promotions, tenure awards, and merit increases than did faculty. With the strong increase in pressure to publish in order to be promoted, colleges of business need to be aware of the possibility of undeserved authorships."

The findings indicate that the Graduate Management Admissions Test (GMAT) is not a significant predictor of student success when considering factors such as undergraduate grade point average and work experience. Furthermore, the results suggest that prior findings in support of the GMAT are the result of missing variables in the model specification. Our results show that undergraduate grade point average alone can be employed as an admission criterion and indicator of potential success in lieu of the GMAT; adopting this criterion instead can streamline the admission process while minimizing student expenses. Within the discussion section the author offers suggestions for reducing the need for the GMAT score information in the admissions process."

A sample of U.S. business textbooks and survey data from entrepreneurship students reveals a significant bias toward VC at the expense of trade credit. Despite this overexposure to VC, students only indicate a very basic understanding of how VC works.

They developed three scale items to measure each factor. Using survey data from MBA students at a private university, the authors estimated structural equation models to explore these relationships empirically. The findings suggest that course content is the strongest predictor of all three outcomes (perceived learning, satisfaction, and quality); it is the only significant factor affecting perceived learning. They also found that professor?student interaction had a significant positive impact on satisfaction, but not on perceptions of quality. Perceptions of quality were influenced significantly by student?student interaction and mentoring?support."

As part of practical philosophy, this kind of inquiry has historically been categorized as one of the humanities. On the other hand, business ethics is also an inquiry into the ethical and moral issues in corporate relationships and activities. Business ethics without humanities is blind, while business ethics without science is superficial. The key to the success of business ethics education is to achieve a balance and connection between the two. One might say that business ethics is the scientific topic with the strongest humanistic undertone, or the humanistic topic with the strongest scientific undertone, in the MBA curriculum. Balancing and connecting science and the humanities is an inherent part of this discipline and provide the solid basis upon which business ethics is included in management education"

The exercise is powerful and may be administered at any level of management training. It is disguised as a negotiation, so the ethical issues are obscured by the parties’ negotiation goals and tactics. The debriefing will lead to productive discussions about personal ethics/values decisions. The exercise can be as simple or complex as the moderator chooses.

Data were collected from business students and faculty at an AACSB-accredited business school at a comprehensive state university. Results indicated that narcissism congruence was significantly related to a student's final grade in the class such that less congruence was associated with lower course grades and that this negative association was partially mediated by perceived professor status and perceived class difficulty. Particularly concerning was the finding that more narcissistic faculty were associated with detrimental outcomes for less narcissistic students. Considering the well-documented and profoundly negative implications of narcissism for workplace environments, this finding suggests a need for future research on the impact of narcissistic faculty on business students and on successful intervention strategies."

As the future success of the accountancy profession depends on its ability to attract high calibre students it should not overlook the significance of school students in its recruitment drive. A questionnaire requiring respondents to rate the importance of 26 factors, synthesised from research on professional career-choice decisions, was completed by school leavers in Ireland. They consider job satisfaction to be the most important criteria when selecting a career, followed by good working conditions and career aptitude. In contrast, neither their parents’ career nor the opportunities to work in their home area are viewed as important. Students intending to pursue an accounting career regard prestige and financial rewards to be more important than those who are not contemplating such a career, while the latter group rank work-life balance, good citizenship and self-fulfilment as more important. The respondents report that their parents and subject teachers are the only people who influence their career decisions with friends, relatives, guest speakers and interestingly, career guidance teachers having no influence."

The proper emotional climate is a complex phenomenon which should involve the right balance of emotions in terms of their valence, intensity, sequence, congruence etc. Adaptation of emotional responses to different situations requires application of contingency approach in creating an optimal emotional climate in the classroom. Invoking Hersey and Blanchard's seminal model of Situational Leadership, this paper provides theoretical background for using certain emotional responses in different situations. Using the contingency paradigm allows for reaching an apt level of theoretical generalization, avoiding one best-way approach on the one hand and addressing emotions on a case-by-case basis on the other. Practical steps for increasing/reducing emotional arousal in class are discussed."

Complementary skills needed by SMEs have been of lesser interest even though several approaches, methods and environments could be utilized. For example, enterprise resource planning systems, business simulation games and practice enterprise models all support the learning of complementary and practical skills the SMEs desperately need. Yet all these learning environments are problematic as they approach business phenomena from narrow viewpoints. In this paper, we present a learning environment that merges these three environments so that they complement each other, allowing the learning of the daily management of SMEs. In this way future employees are better equipped when they enter the labour market, being ready to contribute to the business of SMEs."

The primary aim of the research was to investigate the learning experience and perceptions of the students, and to use the findings to evaluate the effectiveness of the course design and delivery system. Action research was used, with longitudinal data collected over a three-year period (2008–2010). Three survey rounds were conducted focussing on Oman, one of the UK University's main overseas learning collaborating centres. The three rounds yielded 116 valid responses in total. The first survey showed a fairly high level of student satisfaction with the programme but also indicated areas that needed further improvement. The impacts of subsequent changes in the programme were investigated in the second and third surveys. Feedback from these helped develop further changes in the learning content and delivery approach of the programme. The study contributes to a better understanding of global blended learning initiatives, and offers insights to managers on improving course management, enriching learning content, enhancing teaching quality, and improving students' satisfaction levels."

The suggested approach was designed and tested within a project implemented in Austria, the UK, Slovenia and Romania. Evidence from this multi-country study of employers and business graduates suggests that it is possible to investigate industry requirements with a cluster of eight key generic competencies. Competencies were selected following a detailed analysis of academic literature and 39 semi-structured qualitative interviews. A survey was conducted with 900 business graduates and employers in four European countries. The survey confirmed that the eight key competencies selected were both valuable for business graduates' current job performance as well as relevant for future career development. Survey results showed that employers were not very confident in the level of capability of business graduates in the eight competencies investigated in this study. Results are consistent with other empirical evidence concerned with graduates' level of key generic skills and highlight the need to strengthen competency development within undergraduate business education. Implications for future research and curriculum improvement are discussed."

It has also noted that the reciprocal relationship between research and teaching in management has been inadequately studied. This paper addresses this research inadequacy. It briefly outlines that OB courses are unfavorably viewed in the business education and that there is inadequate transmission of research knowledge in teaching. It discusses the need for transmitting OB research-based knowledge in teaching and outlines some of the suggestions contained in the existing research for facilitating such transmission. In light of these suggestions contained in the literature, it describes an actual example that illustrates how OB research-teaching link can be strengthened through two complementary processes of research-based teaching and teaching-inspired research. The example outlined in the paper is in the form of an “illustration”. The specific and concrete example serves to illuminate and illustrate the generalized issue of research-teaching link. The example illustrates one way of addressing the generalized issue of enhancing the research-teaching link. The example also illustrates how the generalized research-teaching-research cycle can operate iteratively to enhance the research-teaching link."

This paper presents an overview of the prevailing theoretical approach to problem-based learning. Then presents a comprehensive review of the empirical literature on problem-based learning with a focus on its application to the management classroom. Finally, the paper presents an alternative, novel pedagogical theory, Montessorian theory, as applied to problem-based learning, that aligns theory and prevailing research better than the existing theoretical conception. Montessorian theory as applied to problem-based learning can lead to a better understanding of the effectiveness of problem-based learning, focus on more appropriate learning objectives and learning outcomes, and have implications for future research, curricular development, and assessment of learning outcomes in the management classroom."

Kolb's (1984) cycle of experiential learning involves experiencing, reflecting, thinking and acting. The researchers contend that the impact of incorporating a simulation in a course can be unlocked by purposefully directing student reflection. Cowan (1998) postulates that students should go through a process of reflecting for, in and on action. Through the use of Participatory Action Research (PAR) the researchers developed and propose educational initiatives that can be employed to encourage student reflection and can be categorised according to Cowan's (1998) model. Additionally, the researchers propose a model of integrative reflection, where reflection is less sequential and reflection for, in and on action overlap. Whilst experience, thinking and acting are imperative, reflection is conceptualised as the phase where the potential of learning in a simulation based course can be enhanced."

It also examines their contributions to sustaining the hegemonic status of the United States. To achieve these objectives, a study in Malaysia was conducted that involved interviews with management educators from three public university business schools as well as analysis of their websites and program prospectuses. The findings suggest that the American influence on local ME practices is substantial. Three key American agents were determined to be responsible for spreading and sustaining the observed hegemony. The author associates the phenomenon with post-war American imperialism and discusses its implications on local ME and business practice."

This paper addresses the gap in educational technology literature on the examination of instructor characteristics. We shift the focus from student outcomes to instructor input, pedagogy and their strategy of technology selection. In particular, we explore instructors' approaches to blended learning, pedagogical aims and instructional design. Our study of management academics at two UK business schools reveals that blended learning adoption varies greatly. Based on forty semi-structured interviews with management academics, we find that this adoption depends on personal predispositions of academics towards educational technology. Personal understanding and interpretations of the blended learning phenomenon cluster into four distinct groups: traditionalist, pedagogy-centric, techno-centric and cautious, and instructional design and delivery preferences vary widely between groups. The findings of this study demonstrate that there is a wide variation in instructor approaches to blended management learning and that manifests itself markedly in the pedagogical strategies and instructional design and delivery of management education."

We develop and test a framework to understand individual and motivational factors that may contribute to subjective indicators of study abroad program success. Specifically, we propose motivational cultural intelligence mediates the relationship of both core self-evaluation and ethnocentrism to successful study-abroad experiences. Data were collected from 183 college-level business students who had recently completed study abroad experiences. Mediation analysis results showed motivational cultural intelligence partially mediated the relationship between core-self-evaluation, and ethnocentrism, and subjective success of study abroad experiences (enjoyment, personal growth, general success). Implications for improving study abroad experiences are discussed."

How participants will make decisions in the simulation is a function of both the participant's expertise and their interaction with the exercise design. It is an important pedagogical issue to know whether the design of the simulation reinforces and builds a participant's ability to respond in a normative reasoned fashion to a decision situation, or to experience the situation in its complexity and respond in a synthetic intuitive fashion. To comprehend the implications of these two viewpoints I present the debate between promoters of the normative views and the descriptive views on decision-making. By performing a critical analysis of these different perspectives, I offer insight on how the decision-making philosophy used in the design of simulations affects both the use of the simulation and the measurable learning outcomes."

The aim of this exploratory case study is to investigate the perceptions of undergraduate accounting students using Twitter as a learning support tool. The literature suggests the use of Twitter supports a range of communication functions as well as pedagogic functions. Although there have been few studies, the educational literature is generally positive about the use of Twitter, whereas there is an emerging non-educational literature about the operational aspects of Twitter which provides evidence of potential limitations in its educational use. This study provided students with a range of experiences using Twitter as a learning support tool. The students involved offered a range of perceptions about its value in supporting accounting education. Overall, this exploratory study demonstrates the relatively complex perceptions of accounting students about using Twitter. It is concluded that while Twitter has some communication and pedagogic potential, educators should plan its use carefully in the context of its limitations and operating dynamics. As a result educators should expect some unpredictability in students' motivation and varying support for its use."

The framework of this study is established around an Australian university's graduate capabilities. This exploratory case study aims to contribute to a graduate-centred understanding of work-readiness. A qualitative methodology was used to map students' perceptions and evaluations of their skill development in criteria referenced graduate capabilities and construct a representation of skill development in graduate capabilities from entry to exit. The more problematic areas of skill development and competence in graduate capabilities were in the higher order skills of inquiry/research, creativity and problem solving and collaborative teamwork. Student respondents appeared to have most difficulty in relating the relevance of inquiry/research to work contexts. This study illustrates the need for university educators and curriculum designers to proactively intervene and develop effective learning activities for individual learners and to regularly monitor and review progression towards desired employability skills from entry to exit. Graduates risk criticism from employers if they leave university with underdeveloped skills on exit from university and for the purpose of transference to employability skills."

As a reflection of this, the research-teaching gap also has been noted in the literature. Possibly as a consequence of this, concerns have been expressed about inadequate transmission of OB knowledge body through OB teaching and about the impaired legitimacy of behavioral coursework in the business education. These concerns in the existing literature suggest a need for examining the nature of OB knowledge body and for exploring the issues it may create for OB teaching. The present paper addresses this research requirement. It first points out the need to examine OB knowledge features and the resulting issues in OB teaching. It then explains why the nature of OB knowledge is likely to affect OB teaching and create issues in OB teaching. It then describes some limiting features of the specific elements –concepts, theories, and empirical findings-in OB knowledge body. In light of the limiting features of the OB knowledge discussed, it then explores some of the resulting issues in OB teaching. Finally, it outlines directions for future research and practice."

If and when unsatisfied with their class performance, or their predicted grade and likelihood of success of the pedagogical innovation, students in the post-innovation group were directed to either self-regulate their class engagement, and/or seek the intervention of the instructor for remedies to facilitate their success. Results show the post-innovation group outperforming the pre-innovation group with more As (+43%), Bs (+35%), with fewer Cs (-20%) supporting the hypothesis that the suggested innovation significantly improved students' performance. However, no significant improvement in the failure rate of the at-risk students (DFWs) was observed. While most students with high predicted probability of passing were able to self-regulate their academic engagement, only few of the at-risk students sought the intervention of the instructor, with the majority eventually succeeding in passing the course (some after several trials) due to their improved class engagement, and their perceptions of the instructor's positive role in facilitating their success."

A questionnaire survey was completed by a sample (N = 1160) of Social Science, Engineering, Science and Business students, across ten Greek universities. Structural equation modelling and latent profile analyses were used. Results provide evidence that students with a family example of entrepreneurship have different emotional predictions compared to students with parents that are employees. Moreover, using anticipated emotions as segmentation variable a four-class taxonomy of students is identified with internal and external validity. The study concludes that anticipated emotions may have a clear adaptive value and provides a basis for persuasive strategies used in an informative way for entrepreneurship education."

Further, the type of plasticity change enables (or disables) or favors (or discourages) different thinking capabilities. Applying these findings, the authors offer an argument that the type of change enabled by teaching-to-repeat (T2R), a passive learning approach prevalent in business education, prepares students' brains to perform in a manner quite different from that valued by business practitioners. Of perhaps greater importance, educational methods of this sort actively discourage the type of brain development consistent with desired capabilities. The authors propose pedagogy – teaching-to-vary (T2V), consistent with development of a different type of plasticity. They argue that by implementing techniques designed to foster variation, working against the brain's tendency toward a preference for the familiar, business educators can both mitigate T2R effects, and better prepare students' brains to manage in uncertain, often turbulent environments. Caveats and suggestions for future research are offered in closing."

This single source for training materials and pedagogical delivery removed any potentially confounding effects that would be associated with engaging more than one person. A statistical assessment of the pre-test and post-test outcomes was conducted within a matched-pair, repeated measures statistical evaluation framework. The findings suggest that a parsed approach to teaching financial literacy, as opposed to a single personal finance course, represents a potentially effective method for addressing the basic financial literacy needs of undergraduate accounting and business students.

The paper proceeds in two sections. First, the subject of industrial organization is defined and discussed in its application to successful entrepreneurship. The second section of the paper looks at two strategy topics relevant to the entrepreneur that are treated extensively in industrial organization. First, the paper looks at how the entrepreneur might consider his initial demand structure and pricing to enter the market. Second, the paper looks at economies of scale as a common barrier to entry in industries. This analysis examines these two strategy topics as examples of how the field of industrial organization is particularly useful for the study of entrepreneurship."

Each student was asked to produce a creative nametag at the beginning of the semester and then again, at the end of the semester. Analysis of variance showed a significant change (ie, increase) in student creativity from pretest to posttest measures. This change was considered reliable when using Pearson r to measure the ratings of the 21 creativity judges (5 expert/16 peer). The two quantitative scales measuring the classroom environment, Professorial Concern (PC) and Affiliation (AF), produced a statistically significant increase in creativity from pretest to posttest."

The results will be of interest to current and prospective center directors, faculty associated with such centers and administrators responsible for directing organizational resources to entrepreneurial activities. We describe the general profile of current centers with regards to institutional resources (human and financial), activities in which the centers engage, levels of student involvement, composition of advisory boards, funding sources and means by which success is measured. We also describe the activities and structure of the typical center director's job. Attributes of centers are correlated with reported measures of success and levels of recognition. Content analysis of open-ended questions provides suggestions as to how excellence is achieved in centers and what challenges the future holds. The paper concludes with summary observations from the results and implications for centers in development or early in their operations. The sampling frame was developed from a general Internet search, use of Entrepreneur magazine lists and the membership list of the National Consortium of Entrepreneurship Centers, and yielded a list of 120 centers. We received responses from 56 entrepreneurship centers for a response rate of 47%. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]"

The sample was broken down based on the primary focus of the school (research versus teaching) and time frame, 1964-1988 versus 1989-2002. Significant differences were found between faculty members' perception of the College's stated requirements for teaching, research, and service compared to the faculty member's own perceived requirements for teaching, research, and service. Furthermore, research schools were found to have a significantly larger amount of A, B, and C refereed journal publications, books authored, and chapters in books. Finally, the findings indicate that 60% of successful tenure candidates at research schools had a least one publication in a top management journal, compared to only 13% at teaching schools. The findings of this study provide a benchmark for faculty and schools when candidates go up for tenure. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]"

Finkle David Deeds",2007,"journal of entrepreneurship education","0dae07d9-262e-34d1-b592-3228516f6b26",NA,"The last decade has seen a dramatic rise in the number and status of entrepreneurship programs in schools of business and management. The popularity of entrepreneurship courses has increased dramatically among both graduate and undergraduate students. Alumni and external constituencies of schools of business have generally been supportive of the development of entrepreneurship programs, and in fact in many instances it has been the demands of these constituencies that have led to the creation or expansion of entrepreneurship programs within these schools. The growth in entrepreneurship programs has been fostered by an increase in the popularity of entrepreneurship, an increase in the status accorded entrepreneurs, as well as an increase in the recognition by the business press of the importance of entrepreneurship in the larger economy. Despite the increase in popularity within the field, there has also been considerable resistance from within the faculties of many institutions to the expansion of entrepreneurship programs. Faculty outside the field have been, and many remain, very skeptical about the validity of entrepreneurship as an academic field, the quality and rigor of entrepreneurship research and the need to hire academic faculty to teach and research in the field. The last decade has seen the confluence of these opposing forces. This disparity has created the question of whether the external forces supporting entrepreneurship are overcoming the inertia inherent in academic institutions and succeeding in institutionalizing the study of entrepreneurship within schools of business and management. This study hopes to shed some light on which of these forces is winning by addressing the question of whether the field of entrepreneurship is moving toward or has been institutionalized as part of the curriculum and research within schools of business and management. It also examines the institutionalization of the field by analyzing the change in the number and level of entrepreneurship positions, the quality of the recruiting institutions as well as the number, level and training of entrepreneurship candidates during the years 1989-1998. Data was obtained from the Academy of Management Placement Roster and The Chronicle of Higher Education for the years 1989-1998. Previous entrepreneurship education researchers have examined the number of endowed chairs and professorships, conferences, journals, programs and various centers for entrepreneurial education, however sparse research, if any, has been performed on the trends and characteristics of candidates and positions in the field of entrepreneurship. The results of this study are very encouraging. Both the demand for and the supply of entrepreneurship faculty have increased spectacularly during the last nine years. Between 1989/90 and 1997/98 the number of entrepreneurship positions increased 253% while the number of candidates increased by 94%. During this period the number of positions that list entrepreneurship as the primary field has increased ten-fold from 5 to 50 and the number of candidates that list entrepreneurship as their primary field has increased four-fold from 5 to 20. During the same period the number of secondary and tertiary positions have increased 116% and 78%, respectively, and the number of secondary and tertiary candidates have increased by 67% and 53%. The percentage of entrepreneurship positions listing entrepreneurship as the primary field has increased from 19% in 89/90 to 54% in 1997/98. Overall, the growth in the number of primary entrepreneurship positions is very encouraging. In the end, the results of this study are very encouraging. Both the demand and the supply of entrepreneurship faculty have increased spectacularly during the last nine years. The field has clearly made significant progress toward being institutionalized. However, it is still too soon to conclude that the commitment to entrepreneurship by schools of business and management is irreversible. One clear indication of the tenuous status is that, unlike strategy and international business, there has been no mandate from the American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business that entrepreneurship be incorporated into the curriculum of all accredited schools. Entrepreneurship remains an elective subject in most schools and therefore depends on student interest. The field has made great strides during the 1990s, but a couple of hurdles remain. © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc."

First, participants will experience a threaded, experiential-learning component to the overall curriculum, and second, to provide an opportunity to advance regional technological research from laboratory to marketplace. In that process a new course focusing on technology assessment and product/service commercialization will be added to the curriculum. In addition, each course offered in the EMBA cohort program, where appropriate, will offer a discipline-specific ""thread"" to support each team's commercialization project.

This research study determined that the theory of planned behavior does predict employment status choice intention. The research also determined that self-employment intentions are directly influenced by pressure from social norms and from perceived behavior control, but not from attitude. Gender and self-employment experience were found not to influence actual employment choice. This study is necessary in order to determine whether entrepreneurship education increases the intention to start a business."

Students involved in engineering capstone design projects, business plan courses and competitions, and research activities have immense potential to conceive and prototype product, process, system, and service concepts within the university classroom and laboratory environment. Faculty members serving as mentors and liaisons to corporate partners generally facilitate the innovation process in the context of their employment as university professionals. The research questions addressed in this paper focus on who actually owns the intellectual property generated in the many possible partnership scenarios that arise among the students, faculty, and outside entities associated with a particular project, as well as whether students and faculty have a working understanding and appreciation of IP ownership. Results from this survey suggest that students feel they own their classroom and laboratory ideas, and that they are somewhat reluctant to share this ownership with their faculty mentors. Student respondents consistently assigned more IP ownership to students compared to faculty, and ascribed less ownership to faculty compared to company management when a corporate entity was involved in a joint university-industry project. Implications of these findings and future research are discussed."

However, self-employed STEM graduates are associated with larger firms. These findings suggest that education policy promoting STEM disciplines may not necessarily result in new firms, but STEM graduates contribute to the growth of employment and subsequently, the economy."

First, TBL teaching is not didactic (learn-recite) but dialectic (reasoning oriented) with activities that revolve around the essential components of critical thinking skills. Second, the small-group peer learning structure dramatically increased student participation in class discussions (we have seen participation rise from 20% to as high as 70% on TBL class days). Third, the immediate (real-time) feedback associated with the TBL technique enhances real-time learning that appears to positively impact subject retention.

The increased demand for a highly skilled workforce has contributed to the rising importance of obtaining a college education. However, recent studies indicate that newly hired college graduates do not excel in these higher-level knowledge and information based skills at the level that employers desire. Entrepreneurs have also indicated that the shortage of highly skilled workers inhibits the growth and development of new entrepreneurial firms. In response to this there have been multiple calls for educators at all levels to recognize the challenges and opportunities in today's economy and to ensure that students develop the ""21st century"" knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) they need. A closer look at these 21st century KSAs alongside research and data on entrepreneurial competencies reveals a meaningful overlap between the two. This overlap can be developed into a useful heuristic to determine appropriate outcomes for assessment of undergraduate entrepreneurship programs.

One hundred and seventy entrepreneurs and prospective entrepreneurs were surveyed in the United States to determine their motivations for business ownership and assess their perceived factors that may have contributed to the success or failure of their ventures. The findings clearly indicate that there is causal linkages between entrepreneurial education (managerial skills), social competence (interpersonal skills), and to a greater degree, basic entrepreneurial training skills and ventures’ effectiveness. They were statistically significant confirming prior expectation of the significant value of entrepreneurship education. The data demonstrates that the entrepreneurial education and training programs appear to create openness, confidence, and trust among the participants in this study.

A dilemma is a situation requiring a choice among problematic alternatives. The distinction between dilemmas and other types of challenges is important because dilemmas cannot be solved--only mitigated. This exposition identifies and explains dilemmas in entrepreneurship pedagogy related to pedagogical structure, entrepreneurial self-efficacy, knowledge specificity, imitative learning, and latent career preferences. An explicit understanding of these dilemmas is valuable because it can assist entrepreneurship educators in recognizing and balancing the abiding tradeoffs inherent in entrepreneurship pedagogy."

Based on the premise that the main goals of entrepreneurship education are a) increasing the level of entrepreneurial competence and b) generating a positive attitude towards entrepreneurial behavior, I take stock of methods and tools that can be utilized to achieve those goals. Furthermore, based on this analysis of the status quo two trends are identified and discussed that may shape the future of entrepreneurship education. These trends are a) the tendency to narrow the scope of entrepreneurship education and to deliver entrepreneurial knowledge to specialized business audiences and b) the opposing tendency to widen the scope of traditional entrepreneurship education by introducing entrepreneurial concepts to audiences that could be considered unusual from a purely business perspective."

Students of entrepreneurial management must appreciate the waves of creative destruction which birth industries, redistribute wealth and alter the basis of competition. Core to this objective is understanding patterns of innovation and technology adoption in the global economy. This includes grasping the diffusion of innovation in one's own industry in order to make accurate business assumptions about the risks and timing of entrepreneurial opportunities, competition, return on investment and the chances of venture success. This research exploited the largest known international database on technology adoption to develop and test innovative teaching tools for entrepreneurship education. The overarching goal was to create interactive visual interfaces to improve teaching on technology adoption and the diffusion of innovation with the aim of improving new venture planning. In entrepreneurship education, technology adoption (also known as the S-curve) is generally taught qualitatively as a cornerstone concept in innovation, competitive analysis and new venture planning. Yet students are rarely, if ever, provided rich data to examine the tempo, implications and varying patterns of technology adoption. Creating an interactive visual interface, we enabled entrepreneurship students to browse and compare international technology adoption data across the leading 25 industrialized countries from 1788-2001 (e.g. for telegraphs, private cars, mobile phones, and industrial robots). Our head-to-head evaluation of our visual interface, called Prism, versus an Excel spreadsheet with identical data showed that entrepreneurship students make more accurate reflections and future forecasts about technology adoption for a wide range of technologies with our tool. We initiated this research to examine ways visual knowledge discovery can improve learning outcomes in entrepreneurship education, including both content delivered face-to-face and in online environments. Our findings suggest data-rich, interactive visual interfaces can strengthen entrepreneurship students' conception of innovation dynamics when planning for and launching a new technology venture.

This research adds to the literature of entrepreneurship education research by investigating the career path of student entrepreneurs during the early stages of the post-graduation period. Three areas of questioning are posited in order to achieve the research goal. The first area of questioning is: how do the careers of student entrepreneurs develop after graduation? The second question area enlarges on the main question of entrepreneurship education research: can entrepreneurship be taught and what is the role of entrepreneurship education in improving student entrepreneurship when prior experience is present? Does education enable entrepreneurship alone? Does education work together with prior experience? Or does prior experience work regardless of education? The third area of questioning concerns what constitutes evidence of the success of entrepreneurship education. Should we consider early venture creation as evidence of success? What about getting a job in a small business? To address these questions, I have conducted a longitudinal study using a panel dataset and a generalized regression model, using a dataset created by combining alumni surveys conducted in multiple years by the University of Florida Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation. On the first question, this study found that speed of venture creation is increased by participating in a formal degree program and from having prior venture experience. On the second question, I conclude that degree program would reduce the time taken to venture creation. On the third question, I question the validity of a career in a small business as evidence of the success of entrepreneurship education.

Although the acquisition and use of basic scientific knowledge is the foundation of drug development, it is unclear how university linkages contribute to biotechnology firms continued operations and development. The goal of this paper is to investigate whether a biotechnology firm’s survival or growth motives influence its participation in university technology transfer activities. In the current study, survival is conceptualized by a firm’s entrepreneurial disposition, and growth options focus on its motivation to secure financial success. Using survey data collected from 198 U.S. biotechnology firms, this study finds significant support for the survival hypotheses and mixed results for those focused on growth."

After reviewing the different approaches used to teach entrepreneurs hip, we propose a new model on how one can teach entrepreneurs hip and test its effectiveness. In a pre-test post-test study, we analyzed the change in Carland Entrepreneurs hip Index score of entrepreneurs hip students engaged in an entrepreneurial activity using Ebay. The result of the analysis showed some significant changes in students score, from -5 points to +11 points with an absolute average change of 4 points (12% change). [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]"

Entrepreneurship offers individuals a chance to build successful careers without having to join large corporations with little ability to impact decisions. Many institutions of higher education around the world have stepped forward to support entrepreneurship by developing programs that provide students with the skills, knowledge, abilities and opportunities to be successful entrepreneurs and small business managers. The types of programs available, however, vary greatly. This study provides a description of these diverse programs from 321 universities located in over 60 countries representing all continents except Antarctica. The programs are described in terms of a number of factors including: courses available, types of programs, faculty positions and infrastructure, program location in the university and types of external support. This substantial descriptive dataset creates an opportunity to better understand differences, and informs efforts to better define best practices and effectiveness metrics.

The competition seeks to encourage students to think of creative ways of using business to create good in the world. Students and alumni who had participated in the SVPC were contacted using an online questionnaire and asked to elaborate on their reasons for participating in the competition, what they learned from the competition, and their willingness to consider social ventures or other entrepreneurial activities as a way to enact positive change in the world. Survey respondents were also asked to complete a scale of proactivity to measure the extent to which they possess the personality characteristics that are associated with a strong likelihood of pursuing entrepreneurial activities. The overall sample mean for the proactivity scale for the students who had participated in the SVPC was substantially higher than the proactivity score of the sample used by Crant (1996) to measure the entrepreneurial intentions of undergraduate and MBA students at a Midwestern university. As the proactivity scale was administered after the SVPC, it is not possible to know if the sample for our study were more proactive than Crant's (1996) sample prior to participating in the competition, or if the higher proactivity ratings were due to their participation in the social venture competition. Follow up questions regarding the SVPC competition revealed that participants' desire to be involved in future entrepreneurial activities was higher than their desire to participate in future social ventures.

A relatively complete business model can be prepared, providing a means to develop and assess a number of alternative approaches to a business opportunity, in a very short period of time and with a modest amount of effort. By way of contrast, business planning is seen as focusing on a specific business proposition and being sufficiently detailed to justify that particular approach and outline an implementation plan with specific strategies, tactics, policy decisions, budgets and milestones. This paper describes the use of business modeling in an introductory entrepreneurship course. This experiment hypothesized that using higher-level business modeling techniques is an effective and appropriate alternative to the common, but more advanced, business planning technique. Instructor and students using this method report: * Increased appreciation of the effort involved in starting a business. * Increased appreciation for the breadth of knowledge and decision-making required to start a business. * Increased awareness of how the various functions and activities of the firm are interconnected. * Increased sense of preparedness to undertake a formal business plan. * Increased sense of whether entrepreneurship is an appropriate personal direction. The paper also suggests business modeling would be valuable to real-world entrepreneurs as a preparatory step before taking a business planning course or workshop. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]"

This method has been used successfully in a school of business in the U.S. The entrepreneurship course in schools of business has grown in popularity since the early 1990s and continues to be a very valuable class in preparing students to develop innovative ventures in their business careers. One mainstream teaching method in entrepreneurship has been the development of a business plan for a new venture. Many other methods of delivery have also been developed at a variety of colleges and universities. Finding a set of best practices to use in structuring an entrepreneurship class is a difficult task. This article examines a unique alternative to teaching entrepreneurship that has been very effective-- benefiting students, faculty, and community. In the process of building a set of best practices, this alternative method may serve to establish a fundamental building block for effectively teaching entrepreneurship courses."

To assess the involvement of historically black colleges and universities HBCUs in the promotion of entrepreneurship, a review of accredited engineering and business programs was conducted to identify the existence of an entrepreneurship focus. Based on the findings, it was concluded that entrepreneurship education is relatively nonexistent within HBCU engineering programs.

This study addresses this issue by reviewing the state of the art about entrepreneurship education through the analysis of the contributions made over the 2000s. Theoretical contributions on entrepreneurship education have been increasing and improving in terms of scope and methodology, but there still seems to be a lack of articles that expand knowledge by simultaneously making new theoretical propositions and testing those propositions in new experimental settings. Articles centered on the development of methods, programs, and frameworks often reflect experiences that are context-specific; empirical validation, when offered, is usually limited to those specific contexts. Theory-building and theory-testing are rooted in single paradigms, limiting the generation of more complete and eclectic knowledge. Entrepreneurship education seems to be more focused on what works in the classroom than on developing cutting edge theoretical contributions. Several lines of inquiry are proposed in order to push the boundaries of existing paradigms and trends and improving practice through theory-building. The present work contributes to the literature by providing an overview of the current state of the field, highlighting main trends and gaps. The application of a taxonomy based on the Business and Management literature to analyze theoretical contributions in the field of entrepreneurship education is original and can provide a means for evaluation of progress in the field over time."

A previous study with students in an Indonesian university showed that the role model is in position to give positive influence to their entrepreneurial motivation, and furthermore, the choice for a future career as an entrepreneur. As a further development, this paper outlines a model whereby the appropriate role of the dominant entrepreneurial role models (who are parents, entrepreneurs and teachers/lecturers) are integrated one with the other and can be used as a source of an entrepreneurial learning process. The lecturer can take on the major task as the facilitator to encourage students to seek the appropriate knowledge about entrepreneurship in this integration whilst the other two constructs can take on their major tasks to act as sources of informal entrepreneurial learning (through social and active learning). Entrepreneurs in particular, can act as a 'business father or mother' to whom students can talk and with whom they can establish a longer informal relationship."

Moreover, the training/firm-size literature has presented a few studies that have diagnosed training needs of this group, albeit to a very limited extent. Nowhere to be found however, within the related literature, is a demand analysis of training needs of this sector or a comparative assessment of training demanded by firm-size. This study has addressed this gap; and argues that training demanded by this very important sector must be met if Jamaican MSMEs are to deliver on the herculean tasks of economic growth, employment generation and poverty alleviation. Utilizing telephone survey and final sample of 200 Jamaican firms, the study found that customer service, managing your business for success and marketing your business were the top three courses demanded by the MSME market. More detailed findings revealed that, in all instances, where demand for training was delineated by firm-size, micro firms had less demand for training courses than small and medium.

Wolff",2014,"Journal of Entrepreneurship Education","48d29881-4e86-3437-b5ac-d2d5cdaa67e2",NA,"This paper presents the results of a course offered at a Midwestern university. The course involved having students evaluate the commercial potential of inventions disclosed to the university. The aim of the course was to identify and select the most promising inventions for inclusion in an internship designed to create business plans and ultimately commercialize the technologies for profit. The results show the inherent risk involved in using a gated approach to evaluating and selecting technologies for commercialization. Consequences technology commercialization programs are discussed."

But particularly in developing country like India, that is undergoing transition from the traditional sustenance to a modern industrial economy, it plays a crucial role in the economic development. The role played by these microenterprises is immense as they are effective tools for employment generation, sustainable livelihood, contributing to the country's GDP and social upliftment of the society. Further, for the development of microenterprise as an effective tool for employment generation and create sustainable livelihood a proper training methods for micro-entrepreneurial skill development should be developed which will increase the efficiency of the microentrepreneurs. The present paper tries to develop a frameworkfor identifying the training methods needed to develop the micro-entrepreneurial skills. Various training methods with its advantages and disadvantages have been given which could be used to upgrade the micro-entrepreneurial skills. It also provides suitable guidelines as to how effective training methods could be designed to facilitate the acquisition of these entrepreneurial skills which will not only create employment generation but also make sustainable livelihood."

"7584","Evaluating the effects of a problem-based learning business planning course on student entrepreneurial intentions","Joseph R. Bell David Dearman James E. Wilbanks",2015,"Journal of Entrepreneurship Education","7a3c873a-6763-3c01-9f5e-a0d185871ef4",NA,"This study examines how a Problem-Based Learning, business-planning course affects student entrepreneurial intentions before and after completion of the coursework. The study looked at student entrepreneurial intentions and the effect of entrepreneurship education in the context of entrepreneurial self-efficacy. That is, perceived competencies indirectly influence intentions to start a new business through the mediating role of entrepreneurial self-efficacy (Zhao et al., 2005). This analysis seeks to address two primary aspects of the coursework: the student's attitude toward the success of the new business venture chosen and, the student's attitude toward self-employment via starting or acquiring a new business (James and Bell, 2013). Student responses were gathered at the point of concept adoption and again at the completion of the written coursework. The findings offer lessons for policy makers and more questions for researchers."
"7585","Individual level assessment in entrepreneurship education: an investigation of theories and techniques","Roisin Lyons Theodore Lynn Ciaran Mac an Bhaird",2015,"Journal of Entrepreneurship Education","a775d4ee-c8c5-38d0-86ae-a1f95be7f59d",NA,"This paper examines a number of commonly used theories and constructs applied to the investigation of the entrepreneur (at the individual level). For each of these theories, an existing measure is selected and assessed on its applicability to the study of entrepreneurship education, reflecting on past research and an empirical investigation in the entrepreneurship education context. Focusing on trait theory, self-efficacy, intentionality and passion, a measure for each construct was investigated by administering it on a sample of students (n=367) taking an entrepreneurship education module. Aspects of the reliability, validity, internal consistency and factor structure of each test were examined using SPSS and MPlus statistical analyses. The findings allow for a direct comparison to be made of the measures in a controlled environment. Theoretically there is a justification for applying each assessment approach to entrepreneurship education. Based on past research it was noted that trait theory has often been criticised for inconsistent empirical findings. This was echoed in our study as empirical analysis supported the use of the entrepreneurial intentionality and entrepreneurial self-efficacy measures, yet the trait measure, the General Enterprise Tendency (GET) test displayed worrisome reliability and structural validities and would not be recommended for future research without significant revision. The measure used to examine entrepreneurial passion was stable in the context, and furthermore suggested that this construct may offer valuable insight about the mind-set of students undertaking entrepreneurship education in future. Limitations of the study include use of a mainly homogenous sample with no control group. The measures for analysis were selected as they were intended for entrepreneurship research and have since been applied to entrepreneurship education. The measures are not reflective of respective theory as a whole. Different and many theories could have been selected, as well as alternative measurement instruments. The measures could have been integrated together into a more complex analysis; however the intended purpose was to examine them in parallel. There have been repeated calls to systematise the assessment of entrepreneurship education, to converge existing knowledge and research. It is hoped that this paper provides educators with an overview and empirical insight regarding theories and measures to adopt for future research and assessment approaches."

UNIVERSITIES & colleges Universities","The paper challenges the traditional view that entrepreneurship education (EE) is effective to raise entrepreneurial awareness and the number of start-ups. We present seven arguments that create doubts about the authorization of current EE at universities. The analysis suggests that most educational programs are nothing but temporary fashion. We claim that the deficits existing in entrepreneurial interests and abilities of young people are caused by rational oriented educational systems, which do not promote creativity, opportunity recognition, and problem solving abilities. The implications suggest to rather concentrate on the promotion of entrepreneurial soft skills than on teaching how to start a business. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]"

Bhandari",2012,"Journal of Entrepreneurship Education","11aedc23-3284-37d1-9503-cc5544798e4f",NA,"This particular article studies if there is a relationship between (a) the students' fathers' current employment, (b) the students' mothers' current employment, (c) the student' own current employment, (d) the students' gender, and (d) the students' intention to become entrepreneurs after they have completed their undergraduate education? The study rejected the first null hypothesis: That there is no statistical difference between these students' fathers' employment-and these students' intention to starting a business once they have completed their undergraduate studies. Likewise, it also invalidated the second null hypothesis: That there is no statistical difference between these students' mothers' employment- and these students' intention to starting a business once they have completed their undergraduate studies. The study also rejected the third null hypothesis: That there is no statistical difference between students' own employment-and their intention to starting a business once they have completed their undergraduate studies. However, the study accepted the fourth null hypothesis: That there is no statistical difference between students' gender-and their intention to starting a business once they have completed their undergraduate studies."
"7589","Entrepreneurial and Accounting Education Through Action-Based Learning : the Genesis Project","Thomas Gstraunthaler Stuart Hendry",2011,"Journal of Entrepreneurship Education","2fdf3775-da8e-3c98-854d-21bbc63b04f3",NA,"Entrepreneurial education should constitute the heart of every business school throughout the world. Despite this imperative, there is still little known about learning processes which equip future entrepreneurs with the right mindset and skills. This paper sets out lessons learned and insights gained, about these learning processes, from the Genesis Project at the University of Cape Town. The Genesis Project is the core course in the Postgraduate Diploma in Entrepreneurship and is run out of the School of Management Studies, which is situated in the Faculty of Commerce at UCT. The course is taught to fourth year students and is designed to provide an intensive action- learning platform in a highly entrepreneurial environment from which students delve into and explore key aspects of entrepreneurship such as creativity, innovation and risk-taking. Participating students were interviewed three times throughout the academic year 2008/2009 to track their learning processes. It is the contention of these authors that in order to develop entrepreneurs one must focus first and foremost on developing an “entrepreneurial mindset”, an ability to think and act creatively and an ability to take risks. Only then do the technical aspects of entrepreneurship, for example, drawing up a business plan and cash flow, become relevant. The paper concludes that entrepreneurial education should take more social and political aspects into account to prepare students with the necessary understanding of social dynamics."
